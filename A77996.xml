            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis worthy Man, eſpecially in his latter times, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded (through Gods bleſſing on him) with a very great confluence of what might give forth <hi>Contentment</hi> to a vaſt Spirit of his Rank and Calling. He was enriched with a large meaſure of Abilities and Opportunities in ſerving his Lord, to glorifie whom, and do much good to others, is the divine part of a man gracious (which he was) the higheſt and moſt ſolid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and in many reſpects exceeds what perſonal Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, ſinglely conſidered, brings in) Beſides, he lived and died in a fulneſs of honour and eſteem with the beſt of men, of Saints; Yea, the worſt of enemies: Likewiſe of Eſtate, and outward Comforts within his Sphaere and Rank, all which might and did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>Contentment</hi> to what was outward in him. In the midſt of theſe, his ſtudy was to finde out a more ſublime way, and hidden art of Self-ſufficiency, than was in the power of all things to contribute or teach; Such a skill as did not only poiſe and compoſe his ſpirit in the preſent injoyment of all, but might fortifie and furniſh him with proviſion for the future againſt the loſs of all, in times wherein <hi>no man knoweth what evil will be in the earth.</hi> This mark his firſt Lines ſhew hee ſhot at. This Art ſome Philoſophers of old pretended themſelves Maſters of, and to inſtruct others in, through the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Natural and Moral Elements, elevated to the utmoſt height their Principles could carry them, but in vain. Their Chymiſtry in this kinde being able to produce no more but a ſullen obſtinacy and obdurateneſs of minde. The <hi>Natural Spirit of a Man,</hi> feeling it ſelf greater than all Creatures, gathering up, and conſolidating it ſelf into it ſelf, is able (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies) <hi>to ſuſtain its own and all other infirmities.</hi> But that <hi>Autarchy</hi> this Author here preſents, is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which <hi>none of theſe Princes of the world know, or the wiſdome of Man teacheth, but the Holy Ghoſt teacheth;</hi> and which few, but thoſe that are <hi>perfect</hi> do attain; Teaching the ſoul to deny it ſelf into weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, emptineſs, in and to it ſelf, and all things elſe; and thus diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to unite its ſelf to Him who only hath bleſſedneſs and All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, with whom aſſociated and made intimate, it melts it ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:132683:4"/>into all his Intereſts, making them its own, and thereby comes to have all that All-ſufficiency of the High God to be its Self-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency: And then, What ſtate can that Soul bee in, wherein it may not bee content? ſeeing it hath God to bee the chiefeſt comfort in its beſt times, and only comfort in its worſt. This though it be the inheritance of every Saint, in the right and title to it, yet the poſſeſſion and injoyment of it, depends upon an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this inheritance, and that upon a skill which is to be <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by experience and much exerciſe (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be Content.</hi> This peece of learning this ſerious ſpirited Man inured himſelf into, and <hi>digging</hi> for it as <hi>Rubies</hi> (as <hi>Solomons</hi> Scholler for Wiſdome) hath found it, and hath hewn forth this <hi>JEWEL</hi> (a Title given neither by Himſelf, nor by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> the Publiſhers, to the Subject it ſelf, yet the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials themſelves deſerving it) out of the Rock, and hath artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially cut it) that the innate Rayes of this ſo glorious a Grace might ſhine forth to others. And here it comes to be preſented, though ſet forth as the richeſt <hi>Jewels</hi> are, often for a while in ruder metals until bargained, but then are placed in tablets worthy of them. The only ſeat this is ordained for, is, the precious Tablets of mens hearts, in, and from which alone, the native luſtre of will be made conſpicuous. Reader, buy it, ſet and wear it there, and it <hi>ſhall</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.22, &amp;c.) <hi>Be life unto thy ſoul, and grace unto thy neck: Thou ſhalt not be afraid when thou ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est down; Yea, thy ſleep ſhall bee ſweet unto thee: for the Lord will be thy confidence.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ERE is a very <hi>ſeaſonable Cordial</hi> to revive the drooping ſpirits of the Saints in theſe ſad and ſinking times: For the <hi>hour of temptation</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come upon all the world to try the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth; and in ſpecial, this is the day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> troubles in our own bowels.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>great Apoſtle</hi> experimentally holds forth in this Goſpel-Text, the very life and ſoul of all practical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; wherein wee may plainly read his own proficiency in Chriſts School; and what leſſon every Chriſtian that would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the power and growth of Godlineſs in his own ſoul, muſt neceſſarily learn from him.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:132683:7"/>
               <p>Theſe words are brought in by <hi>Paul,</hi> as a plain argument to perſwade the <hi>Philippians</hi> that he did not ſeek after great things in the world, and that he ſought not theirs, but them: He did not paſs for a great eſtate; hee had better things to take up his heart withal. I do not ſpeak (ſaith hee) in reſpect of want, <hi>[For]</hi> whether I have or have not, my heart is fully ſatisfied, I have enough; <hi>I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi>

                  <hi>I have learned]</hi> Contentment in every condition is a great Art, a ſpecial Myſtery: It is to be learned, and ſo to be learned as a Myſtery; And therefore verſe 12. he affirms, <hi>I know how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound, every where, and in all things I am inſtructed:</hi>

                  </note> The word which is tranſlated <hi>[Inſtructed]</hi> is derived from that word which ſignifies <hi>Mystery;</hi> and it is as much as if he had ſaid, I have learned the myſtery of this buſineſs. Contentment is to bee learned as a great myſtery; and thoſe that are throughly trained up in that art, have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deep <hi>Mystery;</hi> The which is, as <hi>Sampſons</hi> riddle to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man. <hi>[I have le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> hath in the Original much elegancy and fulneſs of ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in it. In ſtrictneſs of phraſe it is only attributed unto God, who hath ſtiled himſelf <hi>God Alſufficient,</hi> as reſting wholly ſatisfied in and with himſelf alone; but hee is pleaſed freely to communicate of his fulneſs to the creature, ſo that from God in Chriſt, the Saints <hi>receive grace for grace, Joh.</hi> 1.16. In ſo much that there is in them an anſwerableneſs of the ſame grace in their proportion that is in Chriſt. And in this ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I have a <hi>Self-ſufficiency,</hi> as the word notes.</p>
               <p>But hath <hi>Paul</hi> a ſelf-ſufficiency you will ſay? How are wee ſufficient of our ſelves? Our Apoſtle affirms in another caſe, <hi>That wee are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. His meaning therefore muſt be, I find a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:132683:7"/>of ſatisfaction in my own heart, through the Grace of Chriſt that is in me; though I have not outward comforts and worldly accommodations to ſupply my neceſſities, yet I enjoy portion enough betwixt Chriſt and my own ſoul abundantly to ſatisfie me in every condition. And this interpretation is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that place, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.14. <hi>A good man is ſatisfied from himſelf,</hi> and ageeable to what he verifies of himſelf in another place; that <hi>though he had nothing, yet he poſſeſſed all things;</hi> becauſe hee had right to the covenant and promiſe, which virtually contains all, and an intereſt in Chriſt the fountain and good of all, and having that, no marvel he ſaith, that in whatſoever ſtate he was in, he was content. Thus you have the genuine interpretation of the Text. I ſhall not make any diviſion of the words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I take them only to proſecute that <hi>one duty</hi> moſt neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> The quieting and comforting the hearts of Gods people under the troubles and changes they meet withall, in theſe heart-ſhaking times, And the Doctrinal concluſion is in brief this.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That to be well skil'd in the myſtery of Chriſtian Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the Duty, Glory, and Excellency of a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Evangelical truth is held forth ſufficiently in Scripture; yet take one or two parallel places more for the confirmation of it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. and 8. you have both the duty expreſt, and the glory thereof: <hi>Having food and raiment</hi> (ſaith verſe 8.) <hi>let us therewith be content,</hi> there is the duty; <hi>But godlineſs with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is great gain,</hi> verſe 6. there is the glory and excellency of it: as if godlineſs were not gain except there were Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment withal. The like exhortation you have in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as you have.</hi> I do not find any Apoſtle or Writer of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture treat ſo much of the ſpiritual myſtery of Contentment as this our Apoſtle hath done throughout his Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>For the clear opening and proving of this practical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate theſe four things:
<list>
                     <item>Firſt, The nature of this Chriſtian Contentment, what it is.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, The Art and Myſtery of it.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:132683:8"/>
Thirdly, What thoſe leſſons are that muſt be learn'd to work the heart to contentment.</item>
                     <item>Fourthly, Wherein the glorious excellencies of this grace doth principally conſiſt.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, take this deſcription; <hi>Christian Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is that ſweet, inward, quiet, gracious frame of ſpirit, freely ſubmitting to, and taking complacency in Gods wiſe and fatherly diſpoſe in every condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall break open this deſcription, for it is a box of precious Oyntment, very comfortable and uſeful for troubled hearts, in troubled times and conditions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Contentment</hi> (I ſay) <hi>is a ſweet [inward] heart-thing, it is a work of the ſpirit within doors:</hi> It is not only a not-ſeeking help to our ſelves by outward violence, or a forbearance of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented murmuring expreſſions, in froward words and carriages againſt God or others; but it is the inward ſubmiſſion of the heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1. <hi>Truly, my ſoul waiteth upon God;</hi> and verſe 5. <hi>My ſoul wait thou only upon God,</hi> ſo it is in your Books; but the words may be tranſlated as rightly, <hi>My ſoul be thou ſilent unto God; Hold thy peace O my ſoul:</hi> Not only the tongue muſt hold its peace, but the ſoul muſt bee ſilent: Many may ſit down ſilently, forbearing diſcontented expreſſions, yet are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſwollen with diſcontentment; now this manifeſteth a perplexed diſtemper, and a great frowardneſs in their hearts: And God notwithſtanding their outward ſilence, hears the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fretting language of their ſouls. The ſhooe may be ſmooth and neat without, whilſt the fleſh is pinched within: There may be much calmneſs and ſtilneſs outwardly, and yet won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful confuſion, bitterneſs, diſturbance, and vexation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Some are ſo weak that they are not able to contain the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs of their own ſpirits, but in words and behaviour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what woful perturbations there are within, their ſpirits being like the raging Sea, caſting forth nothing but mire and dirt, being not only troubleſome to themſelves but to all thoſe they live with: Others there are who are able to keep in ſuch diſtempers of heart (as <hi>Judas</hi> did when hee betrayed Chriſt with a kiſs) but ſtill they boyl inwardly and eat like a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: As <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks concerning ſome whoſe words are ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:132683:8"/>than honey and butter, and yet have war in their hearts; and as hee ſaith in another place, whilſt <hi>I kept ſilence my bones waxed old;</hi> ſo theſe, whilſt there is a ſerene calm upon their tongues, have yet bluſtring ſtorms in their ſpirits, and whilſt they keep ſilence, their hearts are troubled, and even worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with anguiſh and vexation; they have peace and quiet outwardly, but war from the unruly and turbulet workings of their hearts, that is within. If the attainment to true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment were as eaſie as keeping quiet outwardly, there need bee no great learning of it; it might be had with leſs skill and ſtrength than an Apoſtle had; yea, than an ordinary Chriſtian hath, or may have. Therefore certainly there is a great deal more in it, than can be attained by common gifts, and ordinary power of reaſon, which often bridles in nature. It is a heart bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is the [quiet] of the heart;</hi> All is ſedate and ſtill there, and to underſtand this the better; This quiet gracious frame of ſpirit. It is not oppoſed,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>To a due ſenſe of affliction.</hi> God doth give leave to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be ſenſible of what they ſuffer: Chriſt doth not ſay do not count that a croſs which is a croſs, but take up your croſs daily. As it is in the body natural, if the body takes Phyſick and is not able to bear it, but preſently vomits it up, or if it be not at all ſenſible, if it ſtir not the body either of thoſe waies, the Phyſick doth no good, but argues the body much diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and will hardly bee cured. So it is with the ſpirits of men under afflictions; if either they cannot bear Gods potions, but caſt them up again, or are not ſenſible of them, and their ſouls are no more ſtir'd by them, than the body is by a draught of ſmall beer, it is a ſad ſymptome that their ſouls are in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and almoſt incurable condition. So that this inward quietneſs is not in oppoſition to the ſenſe of affliction: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there were no true Contentment, if you were not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive and ſenſible of your afflictions when God is angry. It is not oppoſed,</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>To an orderly making our moan and complaint to God, and to our friends.</hi> Though a Chriſtian ought to be quiet under Gods correcting hand, yet he may without any breach of Chriſtian
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:132683:9"/>contentment complain to God; (as one of the Antients ſaith) though not with a tumultuous clamour and skreeking out in a perplexed paſſion, yet in a quiet ſtill ſubmiſſive way hee may unboſome his heart unto God. And likewiſe communicate his ſad condition to his gracious friends, ſhewing them how God hath dealt with him, and how heavy the affliction is upon him, that they may ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon to his wearied ſoul. It is not oppoſed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To all lawful ſeeking out for help unto another condition, or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply endeavouring to be delivered out of the preſent affliction by the uſe of lawful means.</hi> No, I may ſay in proviſion for my deliverance and uſe Gods means, waiting on him, becauſe I know not but that it may be his will to alter my condition, and ſo far as hee leads me I may follow his providence, it is but my duty. God is thus far mercifully indulgent to our weakneſs, and he will not take it ill at our hands, if by earneſt and importunate prayer we ſeek unto him for deliverance, till we know his good pleaſure therein. And certainly thus ſeeking for help with ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and holy reſignation of ſpirit, to be delivered when God will, and as God will, and how God will, ſo that our wills are melted into the will of God, this is no oppoſition to the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which God requires in a contented ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But then, what is this quietneſs of ſpirit oppoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>To murmuring and repining at the hand of God; as the diſcontented Iſraelites often did,</hi> which if we our ſelves cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure either in our children or Servants, much leſs can God bear it in us</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>To vexing and fretting;</hi> which is a degree beyond murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. It is a ſpeech I remember of a Heathen, A wiſe man may grieve under, but not bee vexed with his afflictions. There is a vaſt difference betwixt a kindely grieving, and a diſtempered vexation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>To tumultuouſneſs of ſpirit:</hi> When the thoughts run diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctingly, and work in a confuſed manner, ſo that the affections are like the unruly multitude in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who knew not for what end they were come together. The Lord expects that you ſhould be ſilent under his rod, and as hee ſaid in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.36. <hi>You
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:132683:9"/>ought to bee quiet and to do nothing raſhly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>To unſetledneſs and un fixedneſs of ſpirit, whereby the heart is taken off from the preſent duty, that God requires in our ſeveral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both towards God, our ſelves, and others.</hi> We ſhould prize duty at a higher rate than to be taken off by every trivial occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a Chriſtian indeed values every ſervice of God ſo much, that though ſome may bee in the eye of the world and of natural reaſon, a ſlight empty buſineſs, beggarly rudiments, fooliſhneſs, yet ſeeing God calls for it, the authority of the command doth ſo over-awe his heart, that he is willing to ſpend himſelf and to be ſpent in the diſcharge of it. It is an expreſſion of <hi>Luthers,</hi> ordinary works that are done in faith, and from faith, are more precious than Heaven and Earth. And if this bee ſo, and a Chriſtian know it, it is not a little matter that ſhould divert him: but hee ſhould anſwer every avocation and reſiſt every temptation, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did chap. 6.3. <hi>Sanballat, Greſhem, and Tobiah</hi> (when they would have hindered the building of the wall) with this, <hi>I am doing a great work</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come down, why ſhould the work of the Lord ceaſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>To diſtracting heart-eating cares and fears.</hi> A gracious heart ſo eſtimates its union with Chriſt, and the work that God ſets it about, as it will not willingly ſuffer any thing to come in to choak it, or dead it. A Chriſtian is deſirous that the Word of God ſhould take ſuch full poſſeſſion as to divide between ſoul and ſpirit, but hee would not ſuffer the fear and noiſe of evil tidings, to take ſuch impreſſions in his ſoul, as to make a diviſion and ſtrugling there, like the twins in <hi>Rebeckahs</hi> womb. A great man will permit common people to ſtand without his doors, but he will not let them come in and make a noiſe in his cloſet, or bed-chamber, when hee purpoſely retires himſelf from all worldly imployments. So a well-tempered ſpirit though it may inquire after things abroad without doors in the world, and ſuffer ſome ordinary cares and fears to break into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of the ſoul, ſo as to have a light touch upon the thoughts: Yet it will not upon any terms admit of an intruſion into the privy chamber, which ſhould bee wholly reſerved for Jeſus Chriſt as his inward Temple.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>To ſinking diſcouragements,</hi> When things fall not out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:132683:10"/>to expectation, when the tyde of ſecond cauſes runs ſo low, that we ſee little left in the outward means to bear up our hopes and hearts. That then the heart begins to reaſon as he in the <hi>Kings, If the Lord ſhould open the Window of Heaven how ſhould this be?</hi> Never conſidering that God can open the eyes of the Blinde with clay and ſpittle, he can work above, beyond, nay contrary to means; hee often makes the faireſt flowers of mans endeavors to wither, and brings improbable things to paſs, that the glory of enterprizes may be given to himſelf. Nay if his people ſtand in need of miracles to work their deliverance, miracles fall as eaſily out of Gods hands, as to give his people daily bread. Gods bleſſing is many times ſecret upon his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that they know not which way it comes; as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.17. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſee wind, neither ſhall ye ſee rain, yet the valley ſhal be filled with water.</hi> God would have us depend on him though we do not ſee means how the thing ſhould be brought to paſs, elſe we do not ſhew a quiet ſpirit; though an affliction bee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, let not thy heart ſink under it. So far as thy heart ſinks, and thou art diſcouraged under thy affliction, ſo much thou wanteſt of this leſſon of Contentment.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>To ſinful ſhiftings and ſhirkings out for eaſe and help.</hi> As wee ſee in <hi>Saul</hi> turning to the witch of Endor, and his offering ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice before <hi>Samuel</hi> came: Nay, the good King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> joyns himſelf with <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>ult. And</hi> Aſa <hi>goes to</hi> Benhadad <hi>King of Aſſyria for help, not relying upon the Lord</hi> (a <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7, 8) Though the Lord had delivered the Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Army into his hands, conſiſting of a thouſand thouſand, a <hi>Chron.</hi> 14 11. And good <hi>Jacob</hi> joyned in a lye with his mother to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he was not content to ſtay Gods time, and uſe Gods means, but made too great haſte and ſtept out of his way, to procure the bleſſing which God intended for him: as many do through the corruption of their hearts, and weakneſs of their faith, becauſe they are not able to truſt God, and follow him fully in all things alwaies; and for this cauſe the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten follows the Saints with many ſore temporal croſſes, (as wee ſee in <hi>Jacob</hi>) though they obtain the mercy. It may bee thy wretched carnal heart thinks, I care not how I bee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:132683:10"/>delivered, ſo I may but get free from it: Is it not ſo many times in ſome of your hearts when any croſs or affliction befalls you? Have you not ſuch kinde of workings of ſpirit as this? Oh that I could but be delivered out of this affliction any way, I would not care; your hearts are far from being quiet. And this ſinfull ſhifting is the next thing in oppoſition to this quietneſſe, which God requires in a contented ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The Eighth and laſt thing that this quietneſs of ſpirit is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to, is <hi>deſperate riſings of heart againſt God in a way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:</hi> That is moſt abominable. I hope many of you have learned ſo far to be content, as to keep down your hearts from ſuch diſtempers; and yet the truth is, not only wicked men, but ſometimes the very Saints of God find the beginnings of this, when an affliction lies long, and is very ſore and heavy upon them indeed, and ſtrikes them as it were in the maſter vein; they find ſomewhat of this in their hearts, ariſing againſt God, their thoughts begin to bubble, and their affections begin to ſtir in riſing againſt God himſelf; eſpecially ſuch as together with their corruptions have much melancholly, and the Devil wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king both upon the corruptions of their hearts, and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly diſtemper of their bodies; though there may lie much grace at the bottom, yet there may be ſome riſings againſt God himſelf under affliction. Now Chriſtian quietneſs is oppoſite to all theſe things: that is, When afflictions come, be it what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction it will be, yet you do not murmur, though you be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though you make your moan, though you deſire to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and ſeek it by all good means, yet you do not murmur nor repine, you do not fret nor vex, there is not that tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſpirit in you, there is not unſetledneſs in your ſpirits, there are not diſtracting fears in your hearts, no ſinking diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, no baſe ſhiftings, no riſings in rebellion any way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: This is the quietneſs of Spirit under an affliction; and that is the ſecond thing when the ſoul is ſo far able to bear an affliction as to keep quiet under it.</p>
               <p>Now the Third thing I would open in the deſcription is this, <hi>It is an inward quiet, gracious [frame] of Spirit.</hi> It is a frame of Spirit, and then a gracious frame of Spirit. Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is a Soul-buſineſs; Firſt, It is inward; Secondly,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:132683:11"/>quiet; Thirdly, it is a quiet <hi>Frame</hi> of Spirit. <hi>[Frame]</hi> by that I mean theſe three things: There are three things conſiderable when I ſay, Contentment conſiſts in the quiet <hi>frame</hi> of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is a grace that ſpreads it ſelf through the whol ſoul:</hi> as thus, it is in the Judgment, that is, the judgment of the ſoul of a man or woman tends to quiet the heart; in my Judgment I am ſatisfied, that is one thing to be ſatisfied in ones underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and judgment, as thus, this is the hand of God; and this is that that is ſutable to my condition, or beſt for me: although I do not ſee the reaſon of the thing yet I am ſatisfied in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about it.</p>
               <p>And then, <hi>It is in the thoughts of a man or woman:</hi> As my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſatisfied, ſo my thoughts are kept in order.</p>
               <p>And then it comes to the <hi>Will, My will yeelds and ſubmits to it, my affections are all likewiſe kept in order, ſo that it goes through the whol ſoul.</hi> There is in ſome a partial Contentment, and ſo 'tis not the frame of the ſoul, but ſome part of the ſoul hath ſome Contentment: as thus, many a man may be ſatisfied in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about a thing, and yet for his life cannot rule his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor his thoughts, cannot rule his thoughts, nor his will, nor the affections though the judgment be ſatisfied: I make no queſtion, but many of you may know this by your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if you do but obſerve the workings of your own hearts. Cannot you ſay when ſuch an affliction befals you, I can bleſs God I am ſatisfied in my judgment about it, I have nothing in the world to ſay in reſpect of my judgment againſt it, I ſee the hand of God and I ſhould be content, yea, I am ſatisfied in my judgment, that my condition is a good condition in which I am; but I cannot for my life rule my thoughts, my will, and my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, me thinks I feel my heart heavy, and ſad, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than it ſhould be, and yet my Judgment is ſatisfied. This ſeem'd to be the caſe of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>Oh my ſoul why art thou diſquieted? David,</hi> as far as his judgment went, there was a contentedneſs, that is, His judgment was ſatisfied in the work of God upon him; and he was troubled, but he knew not wherefore, <hi>Oh my ſoul, why art thou thus caſt down within me?</hi> That Pſalm is a very good Pſalm for thoſe that feel a fretting, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:132683:11"/>diſtemper in their hearts at any time, for them to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or ſinging: he hath it once or twice in that <hi>Pſalm. Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul?</hi> in verſ. 5. <hi>And why art thou diſquieted within me? hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, for the help of his countenance. David</hi> had enough to quiet him, and that that he had, had prevailed with his judgment, but after it had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with his judgment, he could not get it further. He could not get this grace of Contentment to go through the whol frame of the ſoul. There is a great deal of ſtir ſometimes to get Contentment into their judgments, that is, to ſatisfie their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about their condition: Come to many, that the hand of God is upon, perhaps in a grievous manner, and ſeek to ſatisfie them, and tel them that there is no ſuch cauſe to be diſquieted. O not ſuch cauſe ſaith the troubled ſpirit, O then there is no cauſe that any ſhould be diſquieted; there was never any ſuch affliction as I have! and a hundred things they have to put off what is ſaid to them, ſo as you cannot ſo much as get into their judgments to ſatisfie them; but there is a great deal of hope of Contentment, if once your judgments come to be ſatisfied, that you can ſit down and ſay in your judgments, I ſee cauſe to be contented: but though you have gotten thus far, yet you may have much to do with your hearts afterward: for there is ſuch unrulineſs in our thoughts and affections, that our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not alwaies able to rule our thoughts and affections, and that makes me to ſay, that Contentment is an inward, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, gracious frame of ſpirit, that is, the whol ſoul, Judgment, Thoughts, Will, Affections, and all are ſatisfied and quiet. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the very opening this, you begin to ſee it is a leſſon that you had need learn, and it is not a thing ſoon got, if Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſuch a thing as this is.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is this, which is very obſervable, <hi>That ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Contentment comes from the frame of the Soul.</hi> A man or woman that is contented in a right way, their contentment doth not ſo much come from outward arguments, or any outward thing that helps them to be content, as it doth from the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their own hearts; It is the diſpoſition of their own hearts, that cauſes this Contentment: That brings forth this gracious Contentment, rather than any external thing that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:132683:12"/>doth it, as thus I would open my ſelf, one that is diſquieted, ſuppoſe a childe, or man, or woman if you come and bring them ſome great matter to pleaſe them, that perhaps will quiet them, and they will be contented; it is the thing you bring them that quiets them, but it is not the diſpoſition of their own ſpirits, not from any good temper that there is in their own hearts: but from ſome external thing that is brought them: but when a Chriſtian is contented in a right way, the quiet doth come more from the inward temper and diſpoſition of their own hearts than from any external arguments, or poſſeſſion of any thing in the world. I would yet open this further to you in this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. The being content upon ſome external thing, it is like the warming of a mans cloaths by the fire; but being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by the inward diſpoſition of the ſoul, it is like the warmth that a mans cloaths hath from the natural heat of his body: A man that is of a healthfull body, he puts on his cloaths, and perhaps when he puts them on at the firſt in a cold morning he feels his cloaths cold, but after he hath them on a little while, they are warm; why how come they warm? they come not nigh the fire: No, but it came from the natural heat of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Now a ſickly man that hath his natural heat decayed, if he put on his cloaths cold, they will not be hot in a long time, but he muſt have them warmed by the fire, and then they will quickly be cold again; So this will difference the Contentments of men. There are ſome men now that are very gracious, and when an affliction comes upon them, indeed at firſt it ſeems to be a little cold, but after it hath been on a while, the very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their hearts being gracious, it makes their affliction eaſie, and makes them to be quiet under it, and not to complain of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcontentment. But now you ſhall have others that have an affliction upon them, that have not this good temper in their hearts, their afflictions are very cold upon them, and grievous; and it may be if you bring them ſome external arguments, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from without, as the fire that warms the cloaths, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they will be quiet for a while: but alas, wanting a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpoſition within in their own hearts, that warmth will not hold long. The warmth of a fire, that is, a Contentment that comes meerly from external arguments will not hold
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:132683:12"/>long, but that holds that doth come from the gracious temper of the Spirit. It is from the frame and the diſpoſition of the ſpirit of a man or woman. There's the true Contentment. But this we ſhall ſpeak to further in the opening of the <hi>Myſtery of Contentment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third thing is this, <hi>It is the frame of Spirit that ſhews the habitualneſs of this grace of Contentment.</hi> Contentment is not meerly one act, a flaſh in a good mood; you ſhall have many men and women, that take them in ſome good mood and they will be very quiet; but this will not hold, this is not a conſtant way, there is not a conſtant tenour of their ſpirits to be holy and gracious under affliction: But I ſay, It is the quiet frame of ſpirit, by that I mean, The habitual diſpoſition of their Souls, that it is not only at this time, and the other time when you take men and women in a good mood: but it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tenour and temper of the heart; that is a Chriſtian that hath learned this leſſon of Contentment, that in the conſtant tenour and temper of heart is contented, and can carry its ſelf quietly in a conſtant way, or elſe it is worth nothing; for there is no body that is ſo furious in their diſcontent, but will be quiet in ſome good mood or other. Now Firſt, it is a heart-buſineſs; Secondly, it is the heart quiet; and then Thirdly, it is the frame of the heart.</p>
               <p>But Fourthly, <hi>It is the [gracious] frame of the heart.</hi> Indeed in Contentment there is a compoſition of all graces, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment be Spiritual: if it be truly Chriſtian, there is I ſay a compoſition of all Spiritual graces; As it is in ſome Oyls there is a compoſition of a great many very precious Ingredients: ſo in this grace of Contentment, which we ſhall yet further ſpeak of in the opening of the Excellency of it. But now the gracious frame of Spirit is in oppoſition to Three things?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>In oppoſition to the natural ſtilneſs that there is in many men and women.</hi> There are ſome of ſuch a natural conſtitution that makes them to be more ſtill and more quiet than others: others are of a violent and hot conſtitution, and they are more impatient than others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>In oppoſition to a ſturdy reſolution.</hi> As ſome men through the ſtrength of ſome ſturdy reſolution, they have not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:132683:13"/>ſeemed to be troubled, let come what will come: and ſo it may be through a ſturdy reſolution, at ſome times they are not ſo much diſquieted as others are.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>In way of diſtinction, from the very ſtrength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> (though not ſanctifyed) <hi>the ſtrength of natural reaſon may quiet the heart in ſome meaſure.</hi> But now I ſay a gracious frame of ſpirit is not a meer ſtilneſs of body through a natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temper, nor ſturdineſs of reſolution, nor meerly tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ſtrength of reaſon.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, wherein is this graciouſneſs of Contentment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from all theſe? More of this will be ſpoken to when we ſhew the myſtery of it, and the leſſons that are learned, but now we may ſpeak a little by way of diſtinction here, as now from the natural ſtilneſs of mens ſpirits, many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have ſuch a natural ſtilneſs of ſpirit, and conſtitution of body, that you ſhal find them ſeldom diſquieted. But now mark theſe kind of people that are ſo, they likewiſe are very dull, of a dul ſpirit in any good thing, they have no quickneſs, nor livelineſs of ſpirit in that which is good: but now mark where Contentment of heart is gracious, the heart is very quick &amp; lively in the ſervice of God, yea the more any gracious heart can bring its ſelf to be in a contented diſpoſition, Oh the more fit it is for any ſervice of God, and is very active and lively in Gods ſervice, not dul in the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>And as a Contented heart is very active and ſtirring in the work of God, ſo he is very active and ſtirring in ſanctifying Gods Name in the affliction that doth befal him: The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence will appear very clear thus, One that is of a ſtill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is not diſquieted indeed as others, neither hath he any activeneſs of ſpirit in ſanctifying the Name of God in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: but now one that is content in a gracious way, as he is not diſquieted, but keeps his heart quiet in reſpect to vexing and trouble, ſo on the other ſide, he is not dull nor heavy, but is very active to ſanctify Gods Name in the affliction that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, for it is not enough meerly not to murmur, not to bee diſcontented and troubled, but you muſt be active in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Gods Name in the affliction. And indeed this will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from the other, from a ſturdy reſolution, I will not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:132683:13"/>be troubled: but though you have a ſturdy reſolution, that you will not be troubled, is there a conſcionableneſs in you to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify Gods Name in your affliction, and doth it come from thence? That is the main thing that brings the quiet of heart, and helps againſt diſcontentedneſs in a gracious heart. I ſay the deſire and care that thy ſoul hath to ſanctify Gods Name in an affliction, it is that that quiets the ſoul, which doth not in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Neither when it is meerly from reaſon: As <hi>Socrates,</hi> it is ſaid of him (though he were but an Heathen) that whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel him, he would never ſo much as change his countenance, and he got this power over his ſpirit meerly by ſtrength of reaſon and morality: but now this gracious Contentment comes from principles beyond the ſtrength of reaſon.</p>
               <p>I cannot open that (from whence it comes) til we come to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the myſtery of ſpiritual <hi>Contentment.</hi> I will only give you this one note of difference between a man and a woman that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in a natural way, and another that is contented in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual way. Thoſe that are contented in a natural way, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come themſelves when outward afflictions do befal them, they are contented, yea, and they are contented as well when they commit ſin againſt God, either when they have outward croſſes or when God is diſhonoured, it is all one, either when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are croſt, or when God is croſt; but now a gracious heart that is contented with its own affliction yet mightily riſes when God is diſhonoured.</p>
               <p>The fift is <hi>[Freely] freely ſubmitting to, and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe,</hi> it is a free work of the ſpirit: now there are four things to be opened in this freedom of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the heart is readily brought over, that which one doth freely, there is no great ſtir to bring them to it; there are many men and women, when their afflictions are grievous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, with much ado they are brought to be contented, a great deal of ſtir there is to quiet their hearts when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction, yet at laſt perhaps they are brought to it, I but now this doth not come off freely: if I deſire a thing of another and I get it perhaps with much ado, and a great deal of ſtir there is, but here's no freedom of ſpirit; but when a man is free in a thing, do but mention it, and preſently he comes off to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:132683:14"/>it. So if you have learned this art of Contentment, you will not only be contented after a great deal of do to quiet your hearts, but readily as ſoon as ever you do come to think that it is the hand of God, your heart preſently cloſeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>freely, That is not by conſtraint,</hi> not patience by force (as we uſe to ſay.) As many will ſay that you muſt be coment, this is the hand of God and there is no help for it; O! this is too low an expreſſion for Chriſtians, yet when Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans come to viſit one another, they ſay Friend or Neighbor you muſt be content, this is too low an expreſſion for a Chriſtian, <hi>Muſt be content,</hi> No, readily, and freely I will be content. It is ſutable to my heart to yeild to God, and to be content, I find it is a thing that comes off of it ſelf, that my ſoul will be content. Oh you ſhould anſwer your friends ſo, that come and tell you you muſt be content, nay I am willing to yeild to God, and I am freely content, that's the Second. And then a free act it comes after a rational way, that's freedom, that is, it doth not come through ignorance, becauſe I know no better condition, or that I know not what my affliction is, but it comes through a ſanctified judgment, for that is the reaſon that no Creature can do an act of freedom, but the rational creature, the liberty of action is only in rational creatures, and it comes from hence, for that's only freedom and out of liberty that's wrought in a rational way, as a natural freedom is when I by my judgment ſee what is to be done, underſtand the thing, and then there is a cloſing with what I do underſtand in my judgement, that is freely done; but now if a man doth a thing and underſtands not what he doth, he cannot be ſaid to do it freely. So if men are contented, but it is becauſe they underſtand not what their affliction is, or becauſe they underſtand no better, this is not freely: as for inſtance, Suppoſe a Childe born in a Priſon and never in all his life went out, the Childe is contented, Why? Becauſe he never knew better, but this is no free act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation. But now for men and women that do know better, that know that the condition in which they are in, it is an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted condition and a ſad condition, and yet they can bring their hearts to a Contentation out of a ſanctified judgment, this is freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:132683:14"/>
Thirdly, <hi>This freedom it is in oppoſition to ſtupidneſs,</hi> for a man or woman may be contented meerly out of want of ſenſe, this is not free, as a man in a dead palſie that doth not feel you nip his fleſh, he is not freely patient; but if one ſhould have his fleſh nipt, and feel it, and yet for all that can be able to bridle himſelf, and do it freely, that is another matter. So it is here, many are contented meerly out of ſtupidneſs, they have a dead palſie upon them; but now a gracious heart hath ſenſe enough, and yet is contented, and therefore is free.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Freely [ſubmitting] to, and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe.</hi> Submitting to Gods diſpoſe, What is that? The word <hi>Submit,</hi> it ſignifies nothing elſe but to ſend under; as thus, One that is diſcontented, the heart will be unruly, and would even get above God ſo far as diſcontentment prevailes; but now Comes the grace of Contentment and ſends it under; to ſubmit, it is to ſend under a thing; now when the ſoul comes to ſee the unrulineſs that there is in it, here's the hand of God that brings an affliction, and my heart is troubled and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; what ſaith the Soul? Wilt thou be above God? Is it not Gods hand, and muſt thy will be regarded more than Gods? O under, under O thou ſoul, get under, keep under, keep low, keep under Gods feet; thou art under Gods feet, and keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, keep under the Authority of God, the Majeſtie of God, the Soveraignty of God, the Power that God hath over thee: Keep under, that is to ſubmit; then the Soul can ſubmit to God, when it can ſend it ſelf under the Power and Authority, and Soveraignty, and Dominion that God hath over it; that is the Sixth Particular: Yea but that is not enough, yet you have not got to this grace of Contentment, except in the next place you take.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Taking a [complacency] in Gods diſpoſe.</hi> That is thus, I am well pleaſed in what God doth, ſo far as I can ſee God in it, though as (I ſaid) I may be ſenſible of the affliction, and may deſire that God in his due time would take it off; and uſe means to take it off; yet I may be well pleaſed ſo farr as Gods hand is in it. To be well pleaſed with Gods hand, that is a higher degree than the other: and this comes from hence, not only becauſe I ſee that I ſhould be content in this affliction, but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:132683:15"/>becauſe I ſee that there is good in this affliction. I find there is honey in this rock, and ſo I do not only ſay, <hi>I muſt,</hi> or <hi>I will</hi> ſubmit to Gods hand: no, but the hand of God is <hi>good;</hi> it is <hi>good that I am afflicted.</hi> That it is juſt that I am afflicted, that may be in one that is not truly contented, I may be convinced that God deals juſtly in this, God is righteous and juſt, and 'tis fit I ſhould ſubmit to what he hath done, O the Lord hath done righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly in all his waies: but that is not enough, but thou muſt ſay Good is the hand of the Lord, the expreſſion of old <hi>Ely, Good is the Word of the Lord,</hi> when it was a ſore and hard word, that word that did threaten very grievous things to <hi>Ely</hi> &amp; his houſe, and yet, Good is the word of the Lord, ſaith <hi>Ely.</hi> Perhaps ſome of you may ſay as <hi>David,</hi> It is good that I was afflicted; nay, you muſt come to ſay thus <hi>It is good that I am afflicted.</hi> Not good when you ſee the good fruit that it hath wrought, but when you are afflicted to ſay, It is good that I am afflicted. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the affliction be, yet through the mercy of God my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a good condition; it is the top indeed, and the height of this art of Contentment to come to this pitch, to be able to ſay, Well, my condition and afflictions are thus and thus, and is very grievous and ſore, yet I am through Gods mercy in a good condition, and the hand of God is good upon me notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Now I ſhould have given you divers Scriptures about this, I ſhall but give you one or two that are very remarkable; you will think this is a hard leſſon to come thus far, not only to be quiet, but to have a complacency in affliction. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.6. <hi>In the houſe of the righteous is much treaſure, but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</hi> Here's a Scripture now, that will ſhew that a gracious heart hath cauſe to ſay, it is in a good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatever it be. In the houſe of the Righteous is much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, his houſe, what houſe? it may be a poor Cottage, perhaps he hath ſcarce a ſtool to ſit on; perhaps he is fain to ſit upon a ſtump of wood, a piece of a block inſtead of a ſtool; or perhaps he hath ſcarce a bed to lie upon, or a diſh to eat in; yet ſaith the holy Ghoſt, In the houſe of the righteous is much treaſure: Let the righteous man be the pooreſt man in the world: It may be there are ſome that have come and taken all the goods out of his houſe for debt; perhaps his houſe is plundered and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:132683:15"/>all is gone, yet ſtill, <hi>In the houſe of the righteous is much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> the righteous man can never be brought to be ſo poor to have his houſe rifled and ſpoild, but there will remain much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure within, if he have but a diſh or a ſpoon or any thing in the world in his houſe, there will be much treaſure; ſo long as he is there, there is the preſence of God and the bleſſing of God upon him, and therein is much treaſure; but in the revenues of the wicked there is trouble: There is more treaſure in the pooreſt bodies houſe, If he be Godly, than in the houſe of the greateſt man in the world, that hath his brave hangings, and brave wrought beds, and chairs, and couches, and cupboards of plate, and the like; what ever he hath, he hath not ſo much treaſure in it, as in the houſe of the pooreſt righteous ſoul; therefore in a verſe or two after my text, no marvail though <hi>Paul</hi> (ſaith he) was Content, you ſhall ſee in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18. <hi>But I have all, and abound, I am full.</hi> I have all: Alas poor man what had <hi>Paul</hi> that could make him ſay he had all, where was there ever man more afflicted than <hi>Paul</hi> was? many times he had not tatters to hang about his body, to cover his nakedneſs, he had not bread to eat, he was often in nakedneſs, and put in the ſtocks, and whipt and cruelly uſed, <hi>yet I have all</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) for all that. Yea you ſhall have it in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. He profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there, <hi>That he did poſſeſs all things, as ſorrowfull, yet alwayes rejoycing; as poor, yet making many rich, as having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things,</hi> but mark what he ſaith, it is, <hi>As having nothing,</hi> but it is <hi>Poſſeſſing all things.</hi> He doth not ſay, as poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all things, but poſſeſſing all things; it is very little I have in the world, but yet poſſeſſing all things: So that you ſee a Chriſtian hath cauſe to take complacency in Gods hand, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his hand be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Eight thing in Contentment it is [In Gods diſpoſe] Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe.</hi> That is, the ſoul that hath learned this leſſon of Contentment, looks up to God in all things; looks not down to the inſtruments or the means, as ſuch a man did it, and it was unreaſonableneſs of ſuch and ſuch inſtruments, and the like barbarous uſage of ſuch and ſuch; but looks up to God; a contented heart looks to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſubmits to Gods diſpoſe, that is, ſees the wiſdom of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132683:16"/>God in all, in his ſubmiſſion ſees his ſoveraignty, but that that makes him take complacency, it is Gods wiſdom; the Lord knows how to order things better than I, the Lord ſees further than I do, I ſee things but at preſent, but the Lord ſees a great while hence, and how do I know, but had it not been for this affliction, I had been undone? I know that the love of God <hi>may as well ſtand with an afflicted eſtate, as with a proſperous eſtate;</hi> and ſuch kind of reaſonings there are in a contented ſpirit, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting unto the diſpoſe of God.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing is, <hi>This is in [every condition,]</hi> It may be in ſome things you could be content: You ſhall have many will ſay, if my affliction were but as the affliction of ſuch a one I could be content, yea but it muſt be in the preſent affliction that is upon you. We uſe to ſay, There is a great deal of deceit in Univerſals; in the general, come to any man or woman and ſay, Will not you be content with Gods diſpoſe? Yes ſay they God forbid but we ſhould ſubmit to Gods hand what ever it be; you ſay thus in the general, it is an eaſie matter to learn this leſſon, but when it comes to the particular, when the croſſe comes ſore indeed, when it ſtrikes you in the heavieſt croſs that you think could befall you, what ſaith your heart now? Can you in every condition be content not only for the matter, but for the time, that is to be in ſuch a condition ſo long as God would have you, to be content to be at Gods time in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to have ſuch an affliction ſo long as God would have the affliction abide upon you, to be willing to ſtay and not to come out of the affliction no ſooner than the Lord would have you come out of it? you are not content in your condition elſe; to be content meerly that I have ſuch a hand of God upon me, and not to ſtay under the hand of God, that is not to be content under every condition, but when I can find my heart ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Gods diſpoſe in ſuch particular afflictions that are very hard, and very grievous, and yet my heart is quiet, here is one that hath learned the leſſon of Contentment: Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is the inward, quiet, gracious frame of ſpirit, freely ſubmitting to and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition: That is the deſcription. Now in this there hath been Nine ſeveral things opened.</p>

1. Firſt, That Contentment is a heart work within the ſoul. 2. Secondly, It is the quieting of the heart. 3. Thirdly, It is the frame of the ſpirit. 4. Fourthly, It is a gracious frame. 5. Fifthly, It is the free working of this gracious frame. 6. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is in it a ſubmiſſion to God, ſending the ſoul under God. 7.

Ninthly, In every condition, every condition, though never ſo hard, though it continue never ſo long: Now thoſe of you that have learned to be Content, have learned to attain unto theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things; the very opening of theſe things I hope may ſo far work upon your hearts, as, Firſt, That you may lay your hands upon your hearts upon this that hath been ſaid, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry telling of you what the leſſon is, I ſay may cauſe you to lay your hands upon your hearts, and ſay, Lord I ſee there is more in Chriſtian Contentation than I thought there was, and I have been far from learning this leſſon, I indeed have learned but my A B C in this leſſon of Contentment, I am but in the lower forme in Chriſts ſchool, if I am in it at all; but theſe we ſhall ſpeak to more afterward; but the ſpecial thing I aim'd at in the opening of this point, is to ſhew how great a Myſtery there is in Chriſtian Contentment; and how many ſeveral leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to be learned, that we may come to attain to this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly diſpoſition, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did attain to.</p>

And therein came to this laſt thing <hi>[In every condition]</hi> Now we ſhall a little inlarge that, and ſo proceed.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>Submitting to God in what ever Affliction befalls us: for the kind.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt for the kind, Many men and women will in the general ſay, that they muſt ſubmit to God in affliction; I ſuppoſe now if you ſhould come from one end of this Congregation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpeak to every ſoul thus; Would not you ſubmit to Gods diſpoſe, in what ever condition he ſhould diſpoſe of you to; you will ſay, God forbid it ſhould be otherwiſe, but we uſe to ſay, <hi>There is a great deal of deceit in generals.</hi> In general you would ſubmit to any thing: but what if it be in this and that particular that is moſt croſs to you. Then any thing but that: we are uſually apt to think that any condition is better
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:132683:17"/>than the condition that God doth diſpoſe us to, now here is not Contentment it ſhould not be only to any condition in general, but for the kind of affliction, if it be that which is moſt croſs to you. God (it may be) ſtrikes you in your Childe, Oh if it had been in my Eſtate ſaith one, I ſhould be content; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be ſtrikes you in your Match, Oh ſaith he I had rather have been ſtrucken in my health; and if he had ſtruck you in your health, Oh then if it had been in my trading I would not have cared; but we muſt not be our own carvers, what particular afflictions God ſhall diſpoſe us to, there muſt be Contentment in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There muſt be a ſubmiſſion to God in every afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the time and continuance of the affliction.</hi> It may be faith one I could ſubmit and be content, but this affliction hath been upon me a long time, a quarter of a year, a year, divers years, and I know not how to yeild and ſubmit to it, my pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is even worn and broke: yea it may, it is a ſpiritual afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You could ſubmit to God you ſay in any outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not in a ſoul affliction, or if it were an affliction upon the ſoul, trouble upon the heart, if it were the withdrawing of Gods face, yet if this had been but for a little time I could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; but ſeeking of God ſo long a time and yet God doth not appear, Oh how ſhall I bear this! We muſt not be our own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers for the <hi>time</hi> of deliverance no more than the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of deliverance, and I will give you a Scripture or two about this, That we are to ſubmit unto God for the time as well as the kind, in the latter end of the 1. Chapter of <hi>Ezek. When I ſaw it I fell upon my face, and heard a voyce of one that ſpake,</hi> (the Prophet was caſt down upon his face, but how long muſt he lie upon his face) <hi>And he ſaid unto me, Son of man ſtand upon thy feet and I will ſpeak unto thee, and the Spirit entred into me, when he ſpake unto me, and ſet me upon my feet. Ezekiel</hi> was caſt down upon his face, and there he muſt lie till God bid him ſtand up, yea and not only ſo, but till Gods Spirit came into him to enable him to ſtand up: So when God caſts us down, we muſt be content to lie till God bid us ſtand up, and Gods Spirit enter into us to enable us to ſtand up, So you know <hi>Noah</hi> he was put into the Ark, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he knew there was much affliction in the Ark, having all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:132683:18"/>kind of creatures ſhut up with him for twelve months together, it was a mighty thing, yet God ſhutting him up (though the waters were aſſwaged) <hi>Noah</hi> was not to come out of the Ark till God bid him: So though we be ſhut up in great afflictions, and we may think there may be this &amp; that and the other means to come out of that affliction, yet till God doth open the door we ſhould be willing to ſtay; God hath put us in, and God is to bring us out: As we read in the <hi>Acts,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> when they had ſhut him in Priſon and would have ſent him out: Nay, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> they ſhut us in, let them come and fetch us out: So in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gracious way ſhould a ſoul ſay, Well, this affliction that I am brought into, it is by the hand of God, and I am content to be here till God brings me out himſelf. God doth require at our hands, that we ſhould not be willing to come out till he coms and fetches us out. In <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.10. you have a notable hiſtory there that may very well ſerve our purpoſe; we read of the Prieſts, that the Prieſts bare the Ark and ſtood in the midſt of Jordan: you know when the children of Iſrael went into the Land of Canaan they went through the River of Jordan: Now the going through the river Jordan was a very dangerous thing, only God bad them to go, they might have been afraid that the water might have come in upon them: but mark, it is ſaid, <hi>The Prieſts that bare the Ark ſtood in the midſt of Jordan till every thing was finiſhed that the Lord commanded</hi> Joſhua <hi>to ſpeak unto the People, according to all that</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded</hi> Joſhua, <hi>and the People haſted and paſſed over: And it came to paſſe when all the people were clean paſſed over, that the Ark of the Lord paſſed over, and the Prieſts in the preſence of the people.</hi> Now it was Gods diſpoſe that all the people ſhould paſs over firſt, that they ſhould be ſafe upon the land; but the Prieſts they muſt ſtand ſtill till all the people be paſſed over, then they muſt have leave to go, but they muſt ſtay till God would have them go, ſtay in all that danger, for certainly in reaſon and ſenſe there was a great deal of danger in ſtaying: for the Text ſaith, the people haſted over, but the Prieſts they muſt ſtay till the people be gone, ſtay till God calls them out from that place of danger; and ſo many times it doth prove that God is pleaſed to diſpoſe of things ſo that the Miniſters muſt ſtay longer in danger than the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:132683:18"/>and Magiſtrates and thoſe in publick place, which ſhould make people to be ſatisfied and contented with a lower conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God hath put them into: Though your condition be low, yet you are not in that danger that thoſe in that are in a higher condition; God calls them in publick place to ſtand longer in the gap and place of danger than other people, but we muſt be content to ſtay even in Jordan till the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to call us out.</p>
               <p>And then for the variety of our condition, we muſt be content with the particular affliction, and the times and all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances about the affliction; for ſomtimes the circumſtances are greater afflictions than the afflictions themſelves; And for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, if God will exerciſe us with various afflictions one after another: As that hath been very obſervable even of late, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have been plundered, and come away, afterwards have fallen ſick and died: They have fled for their lives, and afterwards the plague hath come among them, and if not that affliction, it may be ſome other affliction. It is very rare that one affliction comes alone, commonly afflictions are not ſingle things, but they come one upon the neck of another: It may be God ſtrikes one in his eſtate, then in his body, then in his name, wife or childe, or dear friend, and ſo it comes in a various way: it is the way of God ordinarily (you may find it by experience) that ſeldom one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction comes alone, now this is hard when one affliction fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after another, when there is a variety of afflictions, when there is a mighty change in a condition, up and down, this way, and that way; there indeed is the trial of a Chriſtian; there muſt be ſubmiſſion to Gods diſpoſe in them. I remember it is ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Cato</hi> that was a Heathen, that no man ſaw him to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, though he lived in a time when the Commonwealth was ſo often changed, yet it is ſaid of him, he was the ſame though his condition was changed, and he ran through variety of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Oh that it could be ſaid ſo of many Chriſtians, that though their conditions be changed, yet that no body could ſee <hi>them</hi> changed, they are the ſame. Look what gracious ſweet, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temper they were in before, that they are ſtill: Thus we are to ſubmit to the diſpoſe of God in every condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, This that you ſpeak of is good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:132683:19"/>it we could attain to it, but is it poſſible for one to attain to this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is if you get skill in the Art of it, you may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it, and it will prove to be no ſuch difficult thing to you neither, if you underſtand but the myſtery of it; as there's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that men do in their callings, that if a countrey man comes and ſees, he thinks it is a mighty hard thing, and that he ſhould never be able to do it, but that's becauſe he underſtands not the art of it, there is a turning of the hand ſo as you may do it with eaſe. Now that's the buſineſs of this exerciſe, to open unto you the art and myſtery of Contentment: What way a Chriſtian comes to Contentment, there is a great Myſtery and art in it, by that that hath been opened to you there will appear ſome myſtery and art, as that a man ſhould be content with his affliction, and yet throughly ſenſible of his affliction too, to be throughly ſenſible of an affliction, and to endeavour the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it by all lawful means, and yet to be content, there's a myſtery in that, how to Joyn theſe two together, to be ſenſible of an affliction as much as that man or woman that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I am ſenſible of it as fully as they, and I ſeek wayes to be delivered from it as well as they, and yet ſtill my heart abides content, this is I ſay a myſtery that is very hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by a carnal heart; but grace doth teach ſuch a mixture, doth teach us how to make a mixture of ſorrow and a mixture of joy together; and that makes Contentment, the mingling of joy and ſorrow, of gracious joy and gracious ſorrow together, grace teaches us how to moderate and to order an affliction ſo as there ſhall be a ſenſe of it, and yet for all that Contentment under it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are divers things further for the opening of the Mystery of</hi> Contentment.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Thing therefore is this, <hi>To ſhew that there is a great myſtery in it.</hi> One that is contented in a Chriſtian way it may be ſaid of him that he is the moſt <hi>contented</hi> man in the world, and yet the moſt <hi>unſatisfyed</hi> man in the world, theſe two together muſt needs be myſterious, I ſay a contented man as he is the moſt contented, ſo he is the moſt unſatisfied of any man in the world. You never learned the myſtery of contentment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:132683:19"/>it may be ſaid of you, that as you are the moſt contented man, ſo you are the moſt unſatisfied man in the world.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, how is that? A man that hath learned the art of Contentment is the moſt contented with any low condition that he hath in the world, and yet he cannot be ſatisfied with the injoyment of all the world, and yet he is contented if he hath but a cruſt, but bread and water, that is if God diſpoſes of him for the things of the world, to have but bread and water for his preſent condition, he can be ſatisfied with Gods diſpoſe in that; yet if God ſhould give unto him Kingdoms and Empires, all the world to rule, if he ſhould give it him for his portion, he would not be ſatisfied with that; here's the myſtery of it, though his heart be ſo inlarged as the injoyment of all the world and ten thouſand worlds cannot ſatisfy him for his portion; yet he hath a heart quieted under Gods diſpoſe, if he gives him but bread and water; to joyn theſe two together, this muſt needs be a great art and myſtery. Though he be contented with God in a little, yet thoſe things that would content other men, will not content him; The men of the world they ſeek after eſtates, and think if they had thus much, and thus much, they would be content, they aim at no great matters; but if I had (perhaps ſome man thinks) but two or three hundred a year, then I ſhould be well enough; If I had but a hundred a year, or a thouſand a year (ſaith another) then I ſhould be ſatisfyed: but ſaith a gracious heart, If he had ten hundred thouſand times ſo much a year, it would not ſatisfie him, if he had the quinteſſence of all the excellencies of all the creatures in the world, it could not ſatisfie him, yet this man can ſing, and be merry, and joyfull when he hath but a cruſt of bread and a little water in the world: Surely Religion is a great Myſtery, great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, not only in the Doctrinal part of it, but in the Practical part of it alſo. Godlineſs teacheth us this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, Not to be ſatisfied with all the world for our portion, and yet to be content with the meaneſt condition in which we are. As <hi>Luther,</hi> when he had great gifts ſent him from Dukes and Princes, he refuſed it, and ſaith he, I did vehemently proteſt God ſhould not put me off ſo; 'tis not that which will content me. A little in the world will content a Chriſtian for his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:132683:20"/>Mark, here lies the Myſtery of it, A little in the world will Content a Chriſtian for his paſſage, but all the world and ten thouſand times more, will not Content a Chriſtian for his <hi>portion:</hi> Now a carnal heart will be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with theſe things of the world for his portion; and there is the difference between a Carnal heart and a Gracious heart: But ſaith a gracious heart, Lord do with me what thou wilt for my paſſage through this world, I will be content with that, but I cannot be content with all the world for my portion, ſo there is the myſtery of true Contentation. A contented man though he be moſt contented with the leaſt things in the world, yet he is the moſt unſatisfied man that lives in the world. That Soul that is capable of God, can be filled with nothing elſe but God; nothing but God can fill a ſoul that is capable of God: though a gracious heart knows that it is capable of God, and was made for God; Carnal hearts think of no reference to God: but a gracious heart being inlarged to be capable of God, and injoying ſomewhat of him, nothing in the world can fill a gracious heart, it muſt be only God himſelf; and therefore you ſhall obſerve, That let God give what he will to a gracious heart, a heart that is godly, except he gives Himſelf, it will not do; a godly heart will not only have the mercy, but the God of that mercy, as well as its ſelf, and then a little matter is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the world, ſo be it he hath the God of that mercy he doth injoy. In <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7, 9. I ſhall need go no further to ſhew a notable Scripture for this, Compare verſ. 7. with verſ. 9. <hi>And the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding ſhall keep your hearts and minds through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The peace of God ſhall keep your heart. Then in verſ. 9. <hi>Thoſe things which you have both learned and received, and heard and ſeen in me, do; and the God of peace ſhall be with you, The peace of God ſhall keep you, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> This is that that I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from this Text, That the peace of God is not enough to a gracious heart, except it may have the God of that peace. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart could be ſatisfied if he might but have outward peace, though it be not the peace of God; peace in the State and his trading would ſatisfie him: But mark how a godly heart goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a carnal, all outward peace is not enough, but I muſt have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:132683:20"/>the peace of God: But ſuppoſe you have the peace of God, Will not that quiet you? No, I muſt have the God of peace, as the peace of God, ſo the God of peace; that is, I muſt enjoy that God that gives me the peace, I muſt have the cauſe as well as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, I muſt ſee from whence my peace comes, and enjoy the fountain of my peace, as well as the ſtream of my peace; and ſo in other mercies, have I health from God, I muſt have the God of my health to be my portion, or elſe I am not ſatisfied: It is not life, but the God of my life; it is not riches, but the God of thoſe riches that I muſt have, the God of my preſervation, as well as my preſervation; a gracious heart is not ſatisfied without this; To have the God of the mercy, as well as the mercy, In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee, and there is none upon the Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> It is nothing in Heaven or Earth, can ſatisfie me, but thy ſelf; if God give thee not only Earth but Heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt rule over Sun, Moon and Stars, and have the rule over the higheſt of the ſons of men, it would not be enough to ſatisfie thee, except thou hadſt God himſelf; There lies the firſt myſtery of Contentment; and truly a contented man, though he be the moſt contented man in the world, yet he is the moſt unſatisfied man in the world, that is, Thoſe things that will ſatisfie the world, will not ſatisfie him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is this Myſtery in Chriſtian Contentation. <hi>A Chriſtian comes to Contentment, not ſo much by way of Addition, as by way of Subſtraction,</hi> that is his way of Contentment, and that is a way that the world hath no skill in. I open it thus, Not ſo much by the adding to what he would have, or to what he hath, not by adding more to his condition, but rather by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting of his deſires, and ſo to make his deſires and condition to be even and equal. A carnal heart knows no way to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented but this, I have ſuch and ſuch an eſtate, and if I had this added to it, and the other comfort added that now I have not, then I ſhould be contented; it may be I have loſt my Eſtate, if I could have but that given to me, ſo as to make up my loſs, then I ſhould be a contented man: But now Contentment doth not come in that way, it comes not in I ſay by the adding to what thou wanteſt, but by the ſubſtracting of thy deſires; it is all one to a Chriſtian, either that I may get up unto what I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:132683:21"/>would have, or get my deſires down to what I have; either that I may attain to what I do deſire, or bring down my deſires to what I have already attained; my eſtate is the ſame, for it is as ſutable to me to bring my deſire down to my condition, as it is to raiſe up my condition to my deſire. Now I ſay a heart that hath no grace, and is not inſtructed in this Myſtery of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, knows no way to get contentment, but to have his eſtate raiſed up to his deſires; but the other hath another way to Contentment, that is, he can bring his deſires down to his eſtate, and ſo he doth attain to his Contentment. So the Lord faſhions the hearts of the children of men: Now if the heart of a man be faſhioned to his condition, he may have as much contentment as if his condition be faſhioned to his heart; ſome men have a mighty large heart, but they have a ſtraight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and they can never have Contentment when their hearts are big and their condition is little; but now though a man cannot bring his condition to be as big as his heart, yet if he can bring his heart to be as little as his condition, to bring them even, from thence is Contentment. The world is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived in this, To think that Contentment lies in having more than they have; here lies the bottom and root of all Contentment, when there is an evenneſs and proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our hearts and our condition; and that is the reaſon that many that are godly men that are in a low condition, live more ſweet and comfortable lives than thoſe that are richer: Contentment is not alwayes cloathed with ſilk, and purple, and velvets, but Contentment is ſometimes in a ruſſet ſuit, in a mean condition, as well as in a higher; and many men that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have had great eſtates, and God hath brought them into a lower condition, they have had more Contentment in that condition than the other: Now how can that poſſible be? Thus eaſily, For if you did but underſtand the root of Contentment, it conſiſts in the ſutableneſs and proportion of the ſpirit of a man to his eſtate, and the evenneſs, when one end is not longer and bigger than another: the heart is contented, there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that condition; now let God give a man never ſo great riches, yet if the Lord gives him up to the pride of his heart, he will never be contented: But now let God bring any one into
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:132683:21"/>a mean condition, and then let God but faſhion and ſute his heart to that condition and he will be content. As now in a mans going, Suppoſe a man had a mighty long Leg, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Leg were ſhort, why, though one of his Legs be longer than ordinary, yet he could not go ſo well as a man that hath both his Legs ſhorter than he. I compare a long Leg, when one is longer than another, to a man that hath a high condition, and is very rich, and a great man in the world, but he hath a great proud heart too, that is longer and larger than his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: now this man cannot but be troubled in his condition: Now another man that is in a mean condition, his condition is low, and his heart is low too; ſo that his heart and his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is both even together, and this man goes on with more eaſe abundantly than the other doth: So that now a gracious heart works after this manner, The Lord hath been pleaſed to bring down my condition, now if the Lord bring down my heart and make it even with my condition, then I am well enough: And ſo when God brings down his condition, he doth not ſo much labor to raiſe up his condition again, as to bring down his heart to his condition: The Heathens themſelves they had a little glimpſe of this; they could ſay, That the beſt riches that is, it is the poverty of deſires: that is a ſpeech of a Heathen, that is, If a man or woman have their deſires cut ſhort; and have no large deſites, that man and woman they are rich, when they can bring their deſires to be but low: So this is the Art of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Not to ſeek to add to our conditions, but to ſubſtract from our deſires. Another hath this, The way to be rich, ſaith he, it is not by encreaſing of wealth, but by diminiſhing of our deſires; for certainly that man or woman is a rich man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath their deſires ſatisfied, now a contented man hath his deſires ſatisfied; God ſatisfies his deſires, that is, all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he is ſatisfied in his condition for the preſent to be the beſt condition, and ſo he comes to this Contentment by way of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, and not Addition.</p>
               <p>The Third thing in the Art of Contentment is this, <hi>A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian comes to Contentment, not ſo much by getting off his burden that is upon him, as by the adding another burden to him:</hi> this is a way that fleſh and blood hath little skill in. You will ſay, how is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:132683:22"/>this? In this manner, art thou afflicted, and is there a great load and burden upon thee by reaſon of thy affliction? thou thinkeſt there is no way in the world to get Contentment, but O that this burden were but off, O it is a heavy load, and few know what a burden I have! What doeſt thou think there is no way for the Contentment of thy ſpirit, but this getting off thy burden? O thou art deceived, the way of Contentment is to add another burden, that is, labour to load and burden thy heart with thy ſin, and the heavyer the burden of thy ſin is to thy heart, the lighter will the burden of thy affliction be to thy ſoul, and ſo ſhalt thou come to be content: If thy burden were lightened that would content thee, thou thinkeſt there is no way to lighten it but to get it off, but thou art deceived, for if thou canſt get thy heart to be more burdened with thy ſin; thou wilt be leſs burdened with thy afflictions: You will ſay this is a ſtrange way, for a man or woman to get eaſe to their condition when they are burdened, to lay a greater burden upon them? You think there is no other way when you are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but to be jolly and merry, and get into company, Oh no, you are deceived, your burden will come again, alas this is a poor way to get his ſpirit quieted, poor man! the burden will be upon him again; but if thou wouldeſt have thy burden light, if thou canſt get alone and examine thy heart for thy ſin, and charge thy ſoul with thy ſin; if thy burden be in thy eſtate, for the abuſe of it, or if it be a burden upon thy body, for the abuſe of thy health, and ſtrength, and the abuſe of any mercies that now the Lord hath taken away from thee, thou haſt not honoured God with thoſe mercies that thou haſt had, but thou haſt walked wantonly and careleſly; and ſo fall a bemoaning thy ſin before the Lord, and thou ſhalt quickly find the burden of thy affliction to be lighter than it was before; do but try this piece of skill and art, to get your ſouls contented with any low condition that God puts you into; many times in a family, when any affliction befalls them, O what a deal of diſcontentment is there between man and wiſe, if croſt in their eſtates at Land, or ill news from Sea, or thoſe that they truſted are broke, and the like, and perhaps ſomwhat in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily falls croſs between man and wife, or in reference to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:132683:22"/>children or ſervants, and there is nothing but brabling and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content among them, now they many times are burdened with their own diſcontent, and perhaps will ſay one to another This life is very uncomfortable for us to live thus diſcontented ſo as we do; but have you ever tried this way, the husband and the wife? have you ever got alone and ſaid, Come, O let us go, and humble our ſouls before God together, let us go into our chamber and humble our ſouls before God for our ſins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have abuſed thoſe mercies that God hath taken away from us, and we have provok'd God againſt us, O let us charge our ſelves with our ſin, and be humbled before the Lord toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have you tried ſuch a way as this is? Oh you would find the cloud would be taken away, and the Sun would ſhine in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and you would have a great deal more Contentment than ever yet you had: If a mans eſtate be broken, either by plunderers, or any other way; now how ſhall this man have Contentment? how? By the breaking of his heart; God hath broken thy eſtate, Oh ſeek to him for the breaking of thy heart likewiſe; Indeed a broken eſtate, and a whole heart, a hard heart, will not joyn together, there will be no Contentment; but a broken eſtate, and a broken heart, will ſo ſute together, as there will be more Contentment than there was before; add therefore to the breaking of thy eſtate, the breaking of thy heart what thou canſt, and that is the way to be contented in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian manner, which is the Third Myſtery in Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing is this, <hi>It is not ſo much the removing of the affliction that is upon us, as the changing of the affliction, the Metamorphoſing of the affliction, when it is quite turned and changed into another thing:</hi> I mean in regard of the uſe of it, though for the matter the affliction abide ſtill. The way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to a carnal heart its only the removing of the affliction, Oh that it may be gone; no but ſaith a gracious heart, God hath taught me a way for Contentment, though the affliction ſhall continue ſtill for the matter of it, but there is a vertue of grace to turn this affliction into good; it takes away but only the ſting and poyſon of it; As now, Suppoſe poverty, A mans eſtate is loſt; well, is there no way to be contented til your eſtate be made
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:132683:23"/>up again? Till your poverty be removed? Yes, certainly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity would teach Contentment, though poverty continues, yet it will teach you how to turn your poverty into ſpiritual riches; that you ſhall be poor ſtill for your outward eſtate; but this ſhall be altered, whereas before it was once a natural evil to you, it comes now to be turned into a ſpiritual benefit to you, and ſo you come to be content. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> Even <hi>poverty it ſelf it is riches unto holy men:</hi> Godly men do make their poverty turn to be riches, they get more riches out of their poverty than ever they get out of their revenues, out of all their trading in this world; they never had ſuch incomes as they have had out of their poverty; This a carnal heart will think ſtrange, that a man ſhall make poverty to be the moſt gainfull trade that ever he had in the world; I am perſwaded that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians have found it ſo, that they have got more good by their poverty than ever they got by all their riches, you find it in Scripture, therefore think not this ſtrange that I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, you do not find any one godly man that came out of an affliction worſe than when he came into it, though for a while he was ſhaken, yet at laſt he was better for an affliction: but a great many godly men you find have been worſe for their proſperity, ſcarce one Godly man that you read in Scripture of but was worſe for proſperity (except <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> I do not read of any hurt they got by their proſperity that they had) ſcarce (I think) is any one example of any godly man but was rather worſe for his proſperity than better; ſo that you ſee its no ſuch ſtrange thing neither to one that is gracious, that they ſhall get good by their affliction: <hi>Luther</hi> hath ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in his Comment upon the 5. Chapter of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> in the 17 verſe, in his Comment upon that place ſaith, <hi>A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian becommeth a mighty Worker, and a wonderfull Creator,</hi> that is (ſaith he) to create out of heavineſs joy, out of terror comfort, out of ſin righteouſneſs, out of death life, and brings light out of darkneſs. It was Gods Pretogative and great Power, his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Power to command the light to ſhine out of darkneſs; now a Chriſtian is partaker of the Divine Nature, ſo the Scripture ſaith, Grace it is part of the Divine Nature, and being part of the Divine Nature it hath an impreſſion of Gods Omnipotent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:132683:23"/>Power, that is, to create light out of darkneſs, to bring good out of evil, now by this way a Chriſtian comes to be content. God hath given a Chriſtian ſuch a virtue, as can turn afflictions into mercies, can turn darkneſs into light; if a man had the power that Chriſt had when the water pots were fill'd, he could by a word turn the water into wine; if you that have nothing but water to drink, yet if you had a power to turn it into wine then you may be contented: Certainly a Chriſtian hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this power from God, to work thus miraculouſly; it is the nature of Grace to turn water into wine, that is, to turn the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your affliction, into the wine of Heavenly conſolation. If you underſtand this in a carnal way, I know it will be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous for a Miniſter to ſpeak thus before you, and many carnal people are ready to make ſuch expreſſions as theſe to be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, underſtanding them in a carnal way: Juſt as <hi>Nicodem us</hi> in the 3. of <hi>John, What! can a man be born when he is old, can he enter the ſecond time into his mothers womb and be born?</hi> So when we ſpeak of grace that it can turn water into wine, and turn poverty into riches, and make poverty a gainfull trade, ſaith a carnal heart, Let them have that trade if they will, and let them have water to drink, and ſee if they can turn it into wine: Oh! take heed thou ſpeakeſt not in a ſcornfull way of the waies of God; grace hath the power to turn afflictions into mercies. Two men ſhall have one affliction, and to one man it ſhall be as gall and wormwood, and it ſhall be wine, and honey, and delightfulneſs, and joy, and advantage, and riches, to another. This is the myſtery of Contentment, not ſo much by removing the evil, as by metamorphoſing the evil, by changing the evil into good.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing is this, <hi>A Chriſtian comes to this Content ment by making up the wants of his condition, by the performance of the work of his condition.</hi> This is the way of Contentment. There is ſuch a condition that I am in, many wants, I want this and the other comfort, well, how ſhall I come to be ſatisfied and content? A carnal heart thinks this, I muſt have my wants made up, or elſe it is impoſſible that I ſhould be content: No, but ſaith a gracious heart, What is the duty of the condition God hath put me into? Indeed my condition is changed, I was not long
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:132683:24"/>ſince in a proſperous condition, but God hath changed my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: the Lord hath called me no more <hi>Naomi,</hi> but <hi>Marah:</hi> Now what am I to do? What can I think now? Are thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that God requires of me in the condition that he hath now put me into? And let me put forth my ſtrength in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duties of my preſent condition. Others they ſpend their thoughts in thoſe things that ſhall diſturb &amp; diſquiet them; and ſo they grow more and more diſcontented; yea, but let me ſpend my thoughts in thinking what my duty is, what is the duty of my preſent condition which I am in: Oh! ſaith a man whoſe condition is changed, and he hath loſt his eſtate, Had I but my eſtate that I had heretofore, how would I uſe it to Gods glory! But God hath made me to ſee that I did not honor him with my eſtate as I ought to have done, Oh! had I it again, I would do better than ever I did: but this may be but a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore you ſhould rather think, What doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me in the condition I am now brought into? And thou ſhouldeſt labor to bring thy heart to quiet and Contentment, by ſetting thy ſoul on work about the duties of thy preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; And the truth is, I know nothing more availeable for the quieting of a Chriſtian Soul, and getting Contentment, than this, The ſetting thy heart on work about the duties of thy very preſent condition that now thou art in, and take heed of thy thoughts about other conditions as a meer Temptation. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compare the folly of men and women that think to get Contentment with their muſing about other conditions, better than to the way of Children; perhaps they are gotten upon an Hill, and they look a good way off and ſee another Hill, and they think if they were on the top of that, then they were able to touch the clouds with their Fingers; but when they are on the top of that Hill, Alas then they are as far from the clouds as they were before. So it is with many that think, If they were in ſuch a condition then they ſhould have Contentment; and perhaps they get into that condition, and then they are as far from Contentment as before: But then they think if they were in another condition, they would be contented, and then when they have got into that condition, they are ſtill as far from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment as before. No, no, let me conſider what is the duty
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:132683:24"/>of my preſent condition, and content my heart with this, and ſay, Well, though I am in a low condition, yet I am ſerving the Counſels of God in that condition wherein I am; it is the Counſel of God that hath brought me into this condition that I am in, and I deſire to ſerve the Counſel of God in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is a notable Scripture concerning <hi>David.</hi> It is ſaid of him, That he ſerved his Generation, after <hi>David</hi> had ſerved his Generation according to the Will of God, then he ſlept. It is a Speech of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning him, in <hi>Act.</hi> 13.36. So it is in your Books, <hi>After he had ſerved his Generation according to the Will of God:</hi> But now the word that is tranſlated <hi>Will,</hi> it is the <hi>Counſell of God,</hi> and ſo it may be tranſlated as well, <hi>That after</hi> David <hi>in his Generation had ſerved Gods Counſell, then he fell aſleep.</hi> We ordinarily take the words thus, That <hi>David ſerved his Generation;</hi> that is, He did the work of his Generation, that is to ſerve a mans Generation. But it is more plain, if you read it thus: After <hi>David</hi> in his Generation had ſerved the Counſel of God, then <hi>David</hi> fell aſleep. O that ſhould be the care of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſerve our Gods Counſel. What is the Counſel of God? The condition that I am in, God doth put me into it by his own Counſel, the Counſel of his own VVill; Now I muſt ſerve Gods Counſel in my Generation, look what is the Counſel of God in my condition, I muſt look to ſerve that: and ſo I ſhall have my heart quieted for the preſent, and ſhall live and die peaceably, and comfortably, if I be carefull to ſerve Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</p>
               <p>A ſixth thing in the Myſtery of Contentment is this, <hi>A graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart is contented by the melting of his will and deſires into Gods will and deſires,</hi> by this means he gets Contentment; and this is a Myſtery to a carnal heart. It is not by having his own deſires ſatisfied as before, but by melting his will and deſires into Gods will: So that he comes to have (in one ſenſe) his deſires ſatisfied though he hath not the thing that before he did deſire, yet he comes to be ſatisfied in this, becauſe he makes his will to be all one with Gods Will. This is a little higher degree than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the will of God. You all ſay, you ſhould ſubmit to Gods will; but a Chriſtian hath gotten beyond this; that is, he can make Gods will and his to be the ſame: ſo it is ſaid
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:132683:25"/>of Beleevers, that they are joyned to the Lord, and are one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that is, look what Gods Will is, I do not only ſee reaſon to ſubmit to it, but Gods Will is my Will: When the Soul can make over (as it were) its Will to God, It muſt needs then have Contentment. Others would fain get the thing they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, O! but ſaith a gracious heart, that that God would have I would have too; I will not only yeild to it, but I would have it too; A gracious heart hath learn'd this art, Not only to make the Commanding Will of God to be its own will, that is What God commands me to do, I will do it; but to make the Providential will of God, and the Operative will of God to be his will alſo: God commands this thing, which perhaps you that are Chriſtians may have ſome skill in, but whatſoever God works, you muſt will as well as what God commands, you muſt make Gods Providential will, and his Operative Will, as well your Will as Gods Will, and ſo you muſt come to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: Here a Chriſtian makes over his Will to God, and in making over his Will to God, he hath no other Will but only Gods: As ſuppoſe a man makes over his Debt to another man, if that man that I owe the Debt to, be ſatisfied and contented, I am ſatisfied, becauſe I have made it over to him, and I need not be diſcontented and ſay, My Debt is not paid, and I am not ſatisfied; Yes, you are ſatisfied, for he that you made over your Debt to he is ſatisfied. Juſt thus it is for all the world between God and a Chriſtian, a Chriſtians heart makes over his will to God; now then, if Gods will be ſatisfied, then I am ſatisfied, for I have then no will of mine own, it is melted into the Will of God; for ſo that is the excellency of Grace, Grace doth not only ſubject the Will to God, but it doth melt the Will into Gods will, ſo that they are now but one will; what a ſweet ſatisfaction muſt the ſoul have then in this condition, when all is made over to God: You will ſay, This is hard. I will expreſs it a little more: A gracious heart muſt needs have ſatisfaction this way, becauſe godlineſs doth teach him this, To ſee that his good is more in God, than in himſelf; the good of my life, and comforts, and my happineſs, and my glory, and my Riches is more in God than it is in my ſelf: (that perhaps we may ſpeak to further, when we come to the Leſſons that are to be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:132683:25"/>learned.) But upon this it is, that a gracious heart hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, he doth melt his will into Gods; for ſalth he, if God have glory, I have glory, Gods glory is my glory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods will is mine, if God have riches, then I have riches, if God be magnified, then I am magnified, if God be ſatisfied, then I am ſatisfied, Gods wiſdom and holineſs is mine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his will muſt needs be mine, and my will muſt needs be his; here is the art of a Chriſtians Contentment, he melts his will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will of God, and makes over his will to God, <hi>O Lord, thou ſhalt chuſe our inheritance for us,</hi> Pſal. 73.</p>
               <p>The Seventh thing in the Art of Contentment is this, <hi>The Myſtery conſiſts not ſo much by bringing any thing without, to make my condition more comfortable, as to purge out ſomething that is within.</hi> The men of the world now, when they would have Contentment, and want any thing, Oh they muſt have ſomewhat from without to content them; but ſaith a godly man, let me get ſomthing out that is in already, and then I ſhall come to Contentment; As ſuppoſe a man hath an aguiſh humor that makes his drink taſte bitter, now ſaith he, You muſt put ſome Sugar into my drink, and his Wife puts in ſome, and yet the drink taſtes bitter, Why? Becauſe the bitterneſs comes from a bitter cholerick humor within; but let the Phyſician come and give him a bitter Potion to purge out the bitterneſs that is within, and then he can taſte his drink well enough: Juſt thus it is with the men of the world, Oh ſuch a condition is bitter, and if I could have ſuch and ſuch a mercy added to this mercy, then it would be ſweet; now if God ſhould put a ſpoonfull or two of Sugar in, it would be bitter ſtill. But the way to Contentment is to purge out thy luſts and bitter humors. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. <hi>From whence are warrs, and strifes, are they not from your luſts that are within you?</hi> They are not ſo much from things without, but from within; as ſometimes I have ſaid, It is not all the ſtormes that are abroad that can make an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, but the vapors that are got within: and ſo if thoſe luſts that are within thy heart, if they were got out, thy condition would be a contented condition. Theſe are the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious wayes of Godlineſs, that the men of the world never think of, When didſt thou ever think of ſuch a way as this is,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:132683:26"/>for to go and purge out the diſtempers of thy heart that are within: Here are Seven particulars now named, there were a great many more that I had thought of. And now without the underſtanding of theſe things, and the practice of them, you will never come to a true Contentation in your way, Oh you will be bunglers in this Trade of Chriſtianity; but the right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of theſe things, will help you to be inſtructed in it as in a Myſtery.</p>

               <p>Eighthly, <hi>He lives upon the dew of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:</hi> It's the ſimilitude of one <hi>Adrian Junius,</hi> ſetting out a contented man by a <hi>Graſhopper,</hi> leaping and skipping up and down, that lives upon the dew, and he hath this motto, <hi>I am content with what I have, and hope for better.</hi> A Graſhopper doth not live upon the graſs as other things do, you cannot know what it feeds upon; other things though as little as Graſhoppers, yet feed upon ſeeds or little flies, and ſuch things, but the Graſhopper, you know not what it feeds upon: So a Chriſtian can get food that the world knowes not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132683:26"/>of, in a ſecret way is a Chriſtian fed by the dew of the bleſſing of God, a poor man or woman what hath but a little which hath grace, lives a more contented life than his rich neighbor that hath a great deal coming in, we find it ſo ordinarily, ſo that though they have but a little, yet they have a ſecret bleſſing of God going in it, that they are not able to expreſs to any other man; if you would come to them and ſay, How comes it that you live ſo comfortable as you do? they are not able to tell you what they have, but they find there is a ſweetneſs in what they do enjoy, and they know this by experience, that they never had ſuch ſweetneſs in former times, that though they had more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in former times than now they have, yet they know they had not ſuch ſweetneſs; but how this comes they cannot tell; and we may ſhew ſome particulars, even in that Godly men do enjoy, that makes their condition to be ſweet.</p>
               <p>As now, Take theſe four or five particulars that a Godly man finds Contentment in what he hath, though it be never ſo little.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe in what he hath, he hath the love of God,</hi> he hath Gods love to him in what he hath: If a King ſhould ſend a piece of meat from his own table, it is a great deal more comfortable to a Courtier than if he had twenty diſhes at ordinary allowance, if the King ſend but any little thing and ſay, Go and carry this to ſuch a man as a token of my love, Oh how delightful is that unto him! Are your husbands at Sea, and ſend you a token of their love, it is more than forty times ſo much that you have in your houſes already: Every good thing the people of God do enjoy, they enjoy it in Gods love, as a token of Gods love, and coming from Gods eternal love unto them, this muſt needs be very ſweet unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What they have it is ſanctified to them for good;</hi> Other men have what they enjoy in a way of common providence, but the Saints in a ſpecial way; Others have what they have and there is all, they have meat, and drink, and houſes, and cloaths, and money, and that's all. But a gracious heart finds content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this, I have it, and I have a ſanctified uſe of it too, I find God going along with what I have to draw my heart neerer to him, and ſanctifie my heart to him; If I find my heart drawn
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132683:27"/>neerer to God by what I enjoy; its more a great deal than if I have it without any ſanctifying my heart by it; there's a ſecret dew that goes along with it, there's the dew of Gods love in it, and the dew of ſanctification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A gracious heart what he hath, he hath it upon free coſt, he is not like to be called to pay for what he hath:</hi> The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what a godly man hath, and a wicked man, is in this: A godly man is as a child in an Inn; and In-keeper hath his child in his houſe, and the Father provides his dyet, and lodging, and what is fit for him; Now there comes a ſtranger, and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath Dinner and Supper provided, and Lodging, but the ſtranger muſt pay for all; it may be the Childes fare is meaner than the fare of the ſtranger, the ſtranger hath boyled, and roſt, and bak'd; but he muſt pay for it, there muſt come a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for it. Juſt thus it is, many of Gods people have but mean fare; but God as a Father provides it, and it is on free coſt, and they muſt not pay for what they have, it is paid for before; but the wicked in all their pomp, and pride, and bravery, they have what they call for, but there muſt come a reckoning for all, they muſt pay for all in the concluſion: And is it not better to have a little upon free coſt, than to come to have all to pay for? Grace doth ſhew a man that what he hath, he hath it on free coſt, from God as from a father, and therefore muſt needs be very ſweet.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A godly man may very well be content, though he hath but little, <hi>For what he hath he hath it by right of Jeſus Christ, by the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he hath a right to it, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of right to what he hath, than any wicked man can have to what he hath; a wicked man hath theſe outward things; I do not ſay they are uſurpers of what they have, but they have a right to it, and that before God, But how? It is a right by meer donation, that is, God by his free bounty doth give it to them; but the right that the Saints have, it is a right of purchaſe, it is paid for, and it is their own, and they may in a holy manner, and holy way, challenge whatſoever they have need of. We cannot expreſs the right of a holy man, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between his right and the right of the wicked more fully than by this ſimilitude: A Malefactor that is condemned to die,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132683:27"/>yet he hath by favor granted to him his ſupper provided over night, and you cannot ſay though the Malefactor hath forfeited all his right to all things, to every bit of bread, yet if he ſhall have a ſupper granted to him, he doth not ſteal it, though all his right is forfeited by his fault, after he is once condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he hath no right to any thing. So it is with the wicked, they have forfeited all their right to all comforts in this world, they are condemned by God as Malefactors and are going to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if God will in his bounty give them ſomthing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them here in the world, they cannot be ſaid to be theeves or robbers: Now a man hath granted to him a ſupper over night before his Execution, but is that like the ſupper that he was wont to have in his own houſe, when he Eat his own bread, and had his Wife and Children about him? Oh! a diſh of green Herbs at home would be a great deal better than any dainties in ſuch a Supper as that is; but now a Childe of God hath not a right meerly by Donation, but what he hath it is his own through the purchaſe of Chriſt; every bit of bread that thou eateſt, if thou beeſt a godly man or woman, Jeſus Chriſt hath bought it for thee, thou goeſt to market and buyeſt thy meat and drink with thy Money, but know that before thou haſt bought it, or paid Money, Chriſt hath bought it at the hand of God the Father with his blood; thou haſt it at the hands of men for Money, but Chriſt hath bought it at the hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by blood: and certainly it is a great deal better and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now though it be but a little.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There's another thing that ſhews the ſweetneſs that there is in that little that the Saints have, by which they come to have Contentment, whereas others cannot: that is, <hi>Every little that they have, it is but as an earneſt penny of all the glory that is reſerved for them, it is given them by God, but as the fore-runner of thoſe eternal mercies that the Lord intends for them,</hi> Now if a man hath but twelve pence given to him as an earneſt penny for ſome great poſſeſſion that he muſt have; is not that better than if he had fourty pounds given unto him otherwiſe? So every comfort that the Saints have in this world, it is an earneſt penny to them of thoſe eternal mercies that the Lord hath provided for them; as every affliction that the wicked have here it is but the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132683:28"/>beginning of ſorrows, and fore-runner of thoſe eternal ſorrows that they are like to have hereafter in Hell; to every comfort thou haſt, is a fore-runner of thoſe eternal mercies thou ſhalt have with God in Heaven; not only the conſolations of Gods Spirit as the fore-runner of thoſe eternal comforts thou ſhalt have in Heaven; But when thou ſitteſt at thy Table, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceſt with thy Wife and Children, and Friends, thou maieſt look upon every one of thoſe but as a fore-runner, yea, the very carneſt penny of Eternal life unto thee. Now then if this be ſo, no marvel though a Chriſtian be contented; (this is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to the wicked;) I have what I have out of the love of God, and I have it ſanctified to me by God, and I have it of free coſt from God by the purchaſe of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and I have it as a fore-runner of thoſe eternal mercies that are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for me; and in this my ſoul rejoyces. There's a ſecret dew of Gods goodneſs and Bleſſing upon him in his eſtate, that others have not: and by all this you may ſee the meaning of that Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Better is a little with righteouſneſs, than great revenues without right.</hi> A man that hath but a little, yet if he hath it with righteouſneſs, it is better than a great deal without right; yea, better than the great revenues of the wicked: ſo you have it in another Scripture. That's the next Particular in <hi>Chriſtian Contentment;</hi> the myſtery is in this, That he lives upon the dew of Gods bleſſing in all the good things that he doth enjoy.</p>
               <p>The Ninth thing wherein the Myſtery of <hi>Chriſtian Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> conſiſts, is this: <hi>Not onely the good things that he hath, he hath the dew of Gods bleſſing in them, and they are very ſweet to him; but all the afflictions, all the evils that do be fall him, he can ſee love in them all; and can enjoy the ſweetneſs of love in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, as well as in his mercies.</hi> Yea, the truth is, The afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods People come from the ſame Eternal Love that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did come from. And that ſpeech of <hi>Hierom, He is a happy man that is beaten when the ſtroke is a ſtroke of love.</hi> All Gods ſtrokes are ſtrokes of love and mercy, <hi>All Gods wayes are mercy and truth to thoſe that fear him and love him,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. The waies of God, the waies of affliction, as well as the waies of proſperity, are mercy &amp; love to him. Grace gives a man an eye,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:132683:28"/>a piercing eye to pierce into the Counſels of God, thoſe Eternal Counſels of God for good unto him, even in his afflictions to ſee the love of God in every affliction as well as in proſperity. Now this is a myſtery to carnal hearts, they can ſee no ſuch thing perhaps they think God loves them when he proſpers them, and makes them rich; but they think God loves them not when he doth afflict them, that's a Myſtery; but grace inſtructs men in that Myſtery, grace enables men to ſee love in the very frowns of Gods face, and ſo comes to receive Contentment.</p>
               <p>In the tenth place, A godly man hath Contentment in the way of a Myſtery, <hi>Becauſe as he ſees all his afflictions come from the ſame love that Jeſus Chriſt did: ſo he ſees them ſanctified in Jeſus Chriſt, ſanctified as a Mediator,</hi> he ſees (I ſay) all the ſting and venom, and poiſon of them all to be taken out by the vertue of Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator between God and Man: As now for inſtance, Thus, a Chriſtian when he would have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment falls a working, What is my affliction? Is it poverty, that God ſtrikes me withall? Jeſus Chriſt had not a houſe to hide his head in, the Fowls of the air had neſts, and the Foxes had holes, but the Son of Man not a hole to hide his head in: now my poverty is ſanctified by Chriſts poverty, I can ſee by faith the curſe and ſting and venom of my poverty, taken out by the poverty of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt Jeſus he was poor in this world to deliver me from the curſe of my poverty, that it ſhould not be curſed unto me, then my poverty is not afflictive, if I can be contented in ſuch a condition. That is the way, not to ſtand and repine, becauſe I have not what others have, no, but I am poor, and Chriſt was therefore poor that he might bleſs my poverty to me.</p>
               <p>And ſo again, Am I diſcouraged, diſhonored; is my good name taken away? why Jeſus Chriſt he had diſhonor put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he was called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and a Samaritan, and they ſaid he had a Devil in him, all the foul aſperſions that could be were caſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, and this was for me, that I might have the diſgrace that is caſt upon me to be ſanctified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, whereas another man his heart is overwhelmed with diſhonor and diſgrace, and he goes this way to work to get Contentment; perhaps if you be ſpoken ill of, you have no
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:132683:29"/>other way to eaſe and right your ſelves, but if they do rail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, you will rail upon them again; and thus you think to eaſe your ſelves. Oh! but a Chriſtian hath another manner of way to eaſe himſelf; Others rail and ſpeak ill of me, but did they not rail upon Jeſus Chriſt, and ſpeak evil of him? And what am I in compariſon of Chriſt? And the ſubjection of Chriſt to ſuch an evil, it was for me, that though ſuch a thing ſhould come upon me, I might know that the curſe of it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me through Chriſts ſubjection to that evil: thus a Chriſtian can be contented when any body ſpeaks ill of him: Now this is a Myſterie to you, to get Contentment after ſuch a manner as this is. So, if men jeer and ſceff at you, Did they not do ſo to Jeſus Chriſt? they jeered and ſcoffed at him, and that when he was in his greateſt extremitic upon the Croſs, ſay they, Here's the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they bowed the knee, and ſaid, Hail King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and put a reed into his hand and mocked him. Now I get contentment in the midſt of ſcorns and jeers, by conſidering that Chriſt was ſcorn'd, and by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith upon that which Chriſt did ſuffer for me. So, am I in great pain of my body? Jeſus Chriſt had as great pain upon his body as I have, though its true, he had not ſuch kinde of ſickneſs as we have, but yet he had as great pain and tortures in his body, and that that was deadly to him, as well as the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to us: The exerciſing of Faith upon what Chriſt did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, that's the way to get Contentment in the midſt of our pains: one lies vexing and fretting and cannot bear his pain; art thou a Chriſtian? haſt thou ever tried this way of getting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, to act thy faith upon all the pains and ſufferings that Jeſus Chriſt did ſuffer? this would be the way of contentment; and a Chriſtian gets contentment under pains after this manner; ſometimes one that is very godly and gracious, you ſhall have him lie under grievous pains and extremities very cheerfully, and you wonder at it; this is the way that he gets it, he gets it by acting his faith upon what pains Jeſus Chriſt did ſuffer. Thou art afraid of death; the way to get Contentment, it is, by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing thy faith upon the death of Jeſus Chriſt. yea, it may be thou haſt inward troubles in thy ſoul, and God withdrawes himſelf from thee, but ſtill thy faith is to be exerciſed upon the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:132683:29"/>ſufferings that Jeſus Chriſt endured in his Soul, he powred forth his Soul before God, then when he ſweat drops of water and blood, he was in an Agony in his very Spirit, and he found even God himſelf in a way to forſake him; now the acting thy Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt thus, brings Contentment; And is not this a myſtery to carnal hearts? A gracious heart finds Contentment in a way of myſtery: no marvel though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am inſtructed in a Myſtery, to be contented in whatſoever condition I am in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Eleventh place, There is yet a further myſtery (for this I hope you will find a very uſeful point unto you) and you will ſee what a plain way there is, (before we have done) for one that is skill'd in Religion to get Contentment, though it's hard for one that is carnal. I ſay, the eleventh Myſtery in Contentment is this, <hi>A gracious heart hath Contentment by fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt, he is able to hear his burden by fetehing ſtrength from another.</hi> Now this is a riddle indeed, and it would be a ridiculous thing to be ſpoken of in the Schools of Philoſophers, to ſay, If there be a burden upon you, you muſt fetch ſtrength from another, indeed to have another to come and ſtand under the burden, that way they would know; but that you ſhall be ſtrengthened by another's ſtrength that is not neer you to your outward view, that they would think ridiculous: but now a Chriſtian finds ſatisfaction in every condition by getting ſtrength from another, by going out of it ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, and by Faith acting upon Chriſt, and bringing the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt into its own ſoul, and thereby is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to bear whatſoever God layes upon him, by the ſtrength that he finds from Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Of his fullneſs do we receive grace for grace;</hi> there is ſtrength in Jeſus Chriſt not only to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and ſave us, but ſtrength to ſupport us under all our burdens and afflictions, and Chriſt expects that when we are under any burden, that we would act our Faith upon him to draw vertue and ſtrength from him; the acting of <hi>Faith,</hi> that's the great Grace that is to be acted under afflictions, its true, other graces ſhould be acted, but the grace of <hi>Faith</hi> it draws ſtrength from Chriſt, in looking upon him that hath the fulneſs of all ſtrength to be conveyed into the hearts of all Beleevers. Now
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:132683:30"/>if a man hath a burden upon him, yet he can have ſtrength added to him, if the burden be doubled, yet if he can have his ſtrength to be trebled, the burden will not be heavier but ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it was before to our natural ſtrength. Indeed our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions may be heavy, and we cry out, O we cannot bear them, we cannot bear ſuch an affliction: Though thou canſt not tell how to bear it with thine own ſtrength, yet what canſt thou tell what thou ſhalt do with the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt? Thou ſaieſt thou canſt not bear it, why doſt thou think that Chriſt could not bear it? if Chriſt could bear it, why mayeſt not thou come to bear it? You will ſay, can I have the ſtrength of Chriſt: Yea, that is made over to thee by faith, ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>That the Lord is our ſtrength,</hi> God himſelf is our ſtrength, and Chriſt is our ſtrength, divers Scriptures we have that way; that Chriſts ſtrength is thine, made over to thee, that ſo thou mayeſt be able to bear whatſoever lies upon thee, and therefore we find ſuch a ſtrange kind of expreſſion in the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Colloſſians,</hi> praying for the Saints, <hi>That they might be ſtrengthened with all might, according unto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power,</hi> unto what? <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto all patience, and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs, Strengthened with all might, according to the Power of God, the glorious Power of God, unto all patience and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs:</hi> You may not therefore be content with a little ſtrength, ſo that you are able to bear what a man might bear by the ſtrength of reaſon and nature; but to be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with all might, according to the glorious Power of God, unto all patience, and to all long-ſuffering: Oh you that are now under very heavy and ſad afflictions more than ordinary, look upon this Scripture, and conſider how this Scripture is made good in you, why may you not have this Scripture made good in you, if you be Godly? You ſhould not be quiet in your own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, except that you in ſome meaſure do get this Scripture to be made good in you, ſo that-you may with ſome comfort ſay, through Gods mercy I find that ſtrength coming into me that is here ſpoken of in this Scripture. You ſhall labour when you are under any great affliction (you that are Godly) to walk ſo, that others may ſee ſuch a Scripture made good in you; here is the glorious Power of God that doth ſtrengthen his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:132683:30"/>to all ong-ſuffering; and that with joyfulneſs. Alas it may be you do not exerciſe ſo much patience, as a wiſe man or a wiſe woman that hath but natural reaſon. But where is the power of God, the glorious power of God? where is the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening with all might, unto all long-ſuffering and patience, and that with joyfulneſs? It is true, the ſpirit of a man may be able to ſuſtain his infirmities, may be able to ſuſtain and keep up his ſpirits, the natural ſpirit of a man, but much more then when this ſpirit is acted with grace and holineſs, and when it is filled with the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt, this is the way of a godly mans getting contentment, the Myſtery of it, it is by fetching in ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Another Myſtery that there is in it, it is, <hi>That a Godly heart enjoyes much of God in every thing that it hath, and doth know how to make up all wants in God himſelf:</hi> that is another Myſtery, he hath God in what he hath; that I ſpoke to ſomwhat before, in ſhewing the dew of Gods bleſſing in what he hath, for God is able to let out a great deal of his power in little things, and therefore the miracles that God hath wrought, have been as much in little things as in great; now as God lets out a great deal of his power in working miracles in ſmaller things, ſo he lets out a great deal of goodneſs in mercy, in comforting and rejoycing the hearts of his people in little things as well as in great; there may be as much riches in a pearl as in a great deal of lumber; but now this is a diſtinct thing.</p>
               <p>Further, A gracious heart as he lives upon Gods dew in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that he hath, ſo when that little that he hath ſhall be taken from him, what ſhall he do then? Then you will ſay, if a man have nothing, there can be nothing fetcht out of nothing: But if the children of God have their little taken from them, they can make up all their wants in God himſelf: Such a man is a poor man, the plunderers came and took away all that he had, what ſhall he do then when all is gone? But when all is gone, there is an art and skill that godlineſs teaches to make up all thoſe loſſes in God. Many men that have their houſes burnt, go about gathering, and ſo get up by many hands a little; but a Godly man knows whither to go to get up all, even in God
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:132683:31"/>himſelf, ſo as he ſhall enjoy the quinteſſence of the ſame good and comfort as he had before, for a Godly man doth not live ſo much in himſelf as he lives in God. This is now a myſtery to a carnal heart; I ſay, a gracious man doth not live ſo much in himſelf as he doth in God, he lives in God continually; if there be any thing cut off from the ſtream, he knows how to go to the Fountain and makes up all there; God is All in All while he lives; I ſay, it is God that is All in All. <hi>Am not I to thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elkanah</hi> to <hi>Hannah</hi>) <hi>instead of ten children?</hi> So ſaith God to a gracious heart, Thou wanteſt this, thy Eſtate is plundered: Why, Am not I to thee-inſtead of ten Houſes, and ten Shops? I am to thee in ſtead of <hi>All;</hi> yet not only <hi>inſtead</hi> of All, but come to me and thou ſhalt <hi>have All again in me.</hi> This indeed is an excellent Art, to be able to draw from God what it had before in the Creature: Chriſtian, How didſt thou enjoy comfort before; Was the Creature any other to thee but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit, a Pipe that did convey Gods goodneſs to thee? The Pipe is cut off ſaith God, Come to me to the Fountain and drink im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, though the beams be taken away, yet the Sun remains the ſame in the Firmament as ever it was: What is that that ſatisfies God himſelf, but becauſe he doth enjoy all Fulneſs in himſelf? ſo he comes to have ſatisfaction in himſelf: Now if thou enjoyeſt God to be thy portion, if thy ſoul can ſay with the Church, in <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my ſoul.</hi> Why ſhouldeſt thou not be ſatisfied and contented as God? God is contented, he is in eternal Contentment in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; now if thou hadſt that God to be thy portion why ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not thou be contented with him alone? God is contented with himſelf alone; if thou haſt him thou mayeſt be contented with him alone; and it may be, that is the reaſon that thy outward comforts are taken from thee, that God may be All in All in thee: It may be whilſt thou hadſt theſe things here, they did ſhare with God in thy affections, a great part of the ſtream of thy affection ran that way; now God would have the full ſtream run to him: As you know it is with a man that hath water comes to his houſe, and if there be ſeverall Pipes, upon which he finds the water comes but ſcantly into his Waſh-houſe, he will rather ſtop the other Pipes, that he may have all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:132683:31"/>the water come in where he would have it. So here it may be God had ſome ſtream of thy affection that ran to him then when thou didſt enjoy theſe things: Yea, but a great deal was let out to the Creature, a great deal of thy affections did run waſte; now the Lord would not have the affections of his Children to run waſte; he doth not care for other mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but for thine they are precious, and God would not have them to run waſte, therefore doth he cut off thy other Pipes, that thy heart might run wholly upon him: As if you have Children, becauſe you have ſervants perhaps do feed them, and give them things, you perceive that your ſervants do ſteal away the Hearts of your Children, you would hardly be able to bear it, you would be ready to turn away ſuch a ſervant, and when the Servant is gone, the Childe is at a great loſs, it hath not the Nurſe; but the Father or Mother intends by her putting away, that the affections of the Childe might run the more ſtrongly towards himſelf, or her ſelf; and what loſs hath the Childe that the affections that run in a rough Channel before towards the ſervant, it runs towards the Mother? So, thoſe affections that run towards the creature, God would have them run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf, that ſo he may be All in All to thee here in this World. And a gracious heart can indeed tell how to enjoy God to be All in All to him: that is the happineſs of Heaven, to have God to be All in All. The Saints in Heaven have not Houſes and Lands, and Money, and Meat, and drink, and Cloathes. You will ſay they do not need them: Why do they not? It is becauſe God is All in All to them immediately. Now while thou liveſt in this world, thou maieſt come to enjoy much of God, you may have much of heaven, while we live here in this life we maycome to enjoy much of the very life that there is in heaven, and what is that but the enjoyment of God to be all in all to us? There is one text in the <hi>Revelations</hi> that ſpeaks of the glorious condition of the Church that is like to be even here in this world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22. <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therein, for the Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Lamb, are the Temple of it; and the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> They had no need of the Sun or Moon. It ſpeaks of ſuch a glorious condition that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:132683:32"/>the Church is like to be in here in this world; this doth not ſpeak of Heaven: and that appears plainly that this is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Heaven, but of a glorious eſtate that the Church ſhall be in here, in this world, for it follows preſently in the 24. and 26. verſes, <hi>And they</hi> (ſpeaking of the Kings of the earth:) <hi>And the Kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor unto it:</hi> Why, the Kings of the Earth ſhall not bring their glory and honor into Heaven; but this is ſuch a time when the Kings of the Earth ſhall bring in their glory and honor to the Church. And in the 26. verſe, <hi>And they ſhall bring the glory and honor of the Nation into it;</hi> therefore it muſt needs be meant here in this world and not in Heaven. Now if there be ſuch a time here in this world, that God ſhall be All in All, that in no compariſon there ſhall be no ſuch need of Creatures as now there is, then the Saints ſhould labor to live as neer that life as poſſibly they can, that is, to make up all in God: Oh that you would but mind this myſtery, that it may be a reality to the hearts of the Saints in ſuch times as theſe are, they would find this priviledge, that they get by Grace, to be worth thouſands of worlds: Hence is that of <hi>Jacob</hi> that I mentioned in another caſe, it is remarkable, and comes in fully here, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. that notable ſpeech of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> when his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> did meet him, ye find in one place, that <hi>Eſau</hi> he refuſed <hi>Jacobs</hi> preſent, in the 8. verſe, when <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> gave his preſent to him, he refuſed it, and told <hi>Jacob</hi> that he had enough; <hi>What meaneſt thou by all this drove which I meet? And he ſaid, Theſe are to find grace in thy ſight: And</hi> Eſau <hi>ſaid, I have enough.</hi> Now in the 11, verſe there <hi>Jacob</hi> urges it ſtill, (and ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi>) <hi>I beſeech thee take it, for I have enough;</hi> now in your books it is the ſame in Engliſh, <hi>I have enough</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſau;</hi>) and <hi>I have enough</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jacob:</hi>) but in the Hebrew <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> word is different from <hi>Eſau's, Jacob's</hi> word ſignifies, <hi>I have all things,</hi> and yet <hi>Jacob</hi> was poorer than <hi>Eſau.</hi> Oh this ſhould be a ſhame to us, that an <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould ſay, I have enough; but now a Chriſtian ſhould ſay, I have not onely enough; but <hi>I have all:</hi> how hath he all? Becauſe he hath God that is All; And it was a notable ſpeech of one, <hi>He hath all things, that hath him that hath all things.</hi> Surely thou haſt all things becauſe thou haſt him <hi>for thy portion,</hi> who hath all things: God hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132683:32"/>all things in himſelf, and thou haſt God to be thine for thy portion, and in that thou haſt all, and this is the myſtery of Contentment: It makes up all wants in God, this is that that the men of the world have little skill in.</p>
               <p>Now I have divers other things yet to open in the Myſtery of Contentment. I ſhould ſhew likewiſe that a godly man not onely makes up all in God, but finds enough in himſelf to make up all, to make up all in himſelf, not from himſelf, but in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that may ſeem to be ſtranger than the other: to make up all in God is ſomewhat, nay to make up all in himſelf, not from himſelf, but in himſelf, that is, a gracious heart hath ſo much of God within himſelf, that he hath enough there to make up all his wants that are without. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14 A <hi>good man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf,</hi> from that that is within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that is the meaning, a gracious man he hath a bird with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own boſom that makes him melody enough, though he wants muſick, <hi>The Kingdom of heaven is within you:</hi> In <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21. <hi>He hath a Kingdom within him, and a Kingdom of God:</hi> you ſee him ſpoken ill of abroad, he hath a conſcience within him that makes up the want of a name and credit, that is inſtead of a thouſand witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Thirteenth, A <hi>gracious heart fetches Contentment from the Covenant that God hath made with him.</hi> Now this is a way of fetching Contentment that the men of the world know not of: they can fetch Contentment, if they have the creature to ſatisfie them: But to fetch Contentment from the covenant of grace that they have little skill in. I ſhould here have opened two things: Firſt, how to fetch Contentment from the covenant of grace in general. (But I ſhall ſpeak to that in the next Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and now onely a word to the ſecond:) Secondly, how he fetches contentment from the particular branches of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that is, from the particular promiſes that he hath for the ſupplying of every particular want: there is no condition that a godly man or woman can be in, but there is ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or other in the Scripture to help him in that condition. And that is the way of his Contentment, to go out to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and fetch from the promiſe, that which may ſupply: But this is but a dry buſineſſe to a carnal heart; but it is the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:132683:33"/>moſt real thing in the world to gracious heart; When he finds want of Contentment he repairs to the Promiſe, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and falls to pleading the Promiſes that God hath made. As I ſhould have ſhewed ſeveral promiſes that God hath made, let the affliction be what it will, I will but onely mention one that is the ſaddeſt affliction of all; in caſe of the Viſitation and the Plague. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. now thoſe that cannot have their friends come to them by reaſon of the plague, and that cannot have other comforts, in other afflictions they might have their friends and other things to comfort them, but in that they cannot, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.10. <hi>There wall no evil befall thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling;</hi> Then here is a promiſe for the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the 5. and 6. verſes, this is a Scripture to thoſe that are in danger of it. You will ſay, this is a promiſe, that the plague ſhall not come nigh them, but mark theſe two are joyned, <hi>There ſhall no evil befall thee; neither ſhall the plague come nigh thee,</hi> The <hi>evil of it</hi> ſhall not come nigh thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>It doth come to many godly men, and how can they make uſe of this Scripture? it is rather a Scripture that may trouble them, becauſe here is a promiſe that it ſhall not come nigh them, and yet it doth come nigh them as well as others.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, This is the anſwer I would give, The promiſes of outward deliverances that were made to the people of God in the time of the Law were to be underſtood then a great deal more literally, and fulfilled more literally, than in the times of the Goſpel, God makes it up otherwiſe with as much mercy; though God made a covenant of Grace and eternal life in Chriſt with them, yet I think there was another covenant too, that God ſpeaks of as a diſtinct covenant for outward things to deal with his peopleby, according to their waies either in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity, or in outward afflictions, more than now, in a more punctual ſet way, than in the times of the Goſpel; and therefore when the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> did but ſin againſt God, they were ſure to have publick judgements to come upon them, and if they did well, always publick mercies; the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant way of God was to deal with the People of the Jews accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they did well or ill, (in an ordinary way) with outward judgments and outward mercies: but it's not ſo now in theſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:132683:33"/>times of the Goſpel; we cannot bring ſuch a certain concluſion, that God did deal ſo ſeverely with men by ſuch and ſuch afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he will deal ſo with them now: and ſo that they ſhall have outward proſperity as they had then: therefore that is the firſt thing for the underſtanding of this and all other texts of that kind.</p>
               <p>The ſecond anſwer I would give is this: It may be their faith doth not reach to this promiſe; and God brings many times many outward afflictions, becauſe the faith of his people doth not reach the promiſe, and that not only in the old Teſtament, but in the time of the new Teſtament; <hi>Zachariah</hi> his time may be ſaid to be in the time of the new Teſtament, when he was ſtruck with dumbneſs becauſe he did not believe, and that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be the cauſe why he was ſtruck with dumbneſs. But you will ſay now, Hath Faith warrant to believe deliverance, that it ſhall be fully delivered? I dare not ſay ſo, but it may act upon it, to believe that God will make it good his own way; perhaps you have not done ſo much, and ſo upon that, this promiſe is not fulfilled to you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When God doth make ſuch promiſes to his people, yet ſtill it muſt be with this reſervation, that God muſt have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to theſe three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That notwithſtanding his promiſe, he will have liberty to make uſe of any thing for your chaſtiſement.</item>
                  <item>2. That he muſt have liberty to make uſe of your eſtates, or liberties, or lives, for the furtherance of his own ends: If it be to be a ſtumbling block to wicked and ungodly men, God muſt have liberty; though he hath made a promiſe to you, he will not loſe the propriety that he hath in your eſtates and lives.</item>
                  <item>3. God muſt have ſo much liberty to make uſe of what you have, for to ſhew that his ways are unſearchable, and his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſt finding out, God reſerves theſe three things in his hand ſtill.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>What good is there then in ſuch a promiſe that God makes to his people?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That thou art under the protection of God more than others. <hi>Obj.</hi> But what comfort is this if it doth befall me?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:132683:34"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou haſt this comfort, that the evil of it ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from thee, that if God will make uſe of this affliction for other ends, yet he will do it ſo as he will make it up to thee ſome other way. Perhaps you have given your children ſuch a thing, but yet afterwards if you have uſe of that thing, you will come and ſay, I muſt have it, Why father may the childe ſay, you gave it me? But ſaith the father I muſt have it, and I will make it up to you ſome other way: Now the childe doth not think that the fathers love is ever a whit the leſs to him. So when there is any ſuch promiſe as this is, that God by his promiſe gives thee his protection, and yet for all that ſuch a thing befalls thee, it is but as if the father ſhould ſay, I gave you that indeed, but let me have it and I will make it up to you ſome other way that ſhall be as good; ſaith God, let me have your health and liberty, and life, and it ſhall be made up to you ſome other way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When ever the plague or peſtilence comes to thoſe that are under ſuch a promiſe, it is for ſome ſpecial and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work, and God requires of them to ſearch and examine in a ſpecial manner to find out his meaning; there is ſo much to be learned in the promiſe that God hath made concerning this particular evil, that the people of God they may come to quiet and content their hearts in this affliction. I read in this <hi>Pſalm</hi> that God hath made a promiſe to his people, to deliver them from the plague and peſtilence, and yet I do find it to come: It may be I have not made uſe of my faith in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe heretofore: and if God do bring afflictions upon me, yet God will make it up ſome other way, God made a promiſe to deliver me, or at leaſt to deliver me from all the evil of it, now if this thing doth befall me and yet I have a promiſe of God, certainly the evil of it is taken away, this promiſe tells me that if it doth befall me, yet it is for ſome notable end, and becauſe God hath uſe of my life, and intends to fetch about his glory ſome way that I know not of: And if he will come in a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of chaſtiſement, yet I will be ſatisfied in the thing: So a Chriſtian heart by reaſoning out of the Word, comes to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his ſoul in the middeſt of ſuch a heavy hand of God, and in ſuch a diſtreſſed condition as that is. Now carnal hearts they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:132683:34"/>find not power in the VVord, that healing vertue that there is in the Word, to heal their diſtracted cares, and the troubles of their ſpirits; but now, thoſe that are godly when they come to hear the Word, they find out, that in the VVord there is a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to all their wounds, and ſo they come to have eaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, in ſuch conditions as are very grievous and miſerable unto others. But now, for other particular promiſes, and more generally for the Covenant of Grace, how, and in what myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious way the Saints do work to fetch out Contentment and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to their ſouls, we ſhall refer to the next time.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the laſt exerciſe we ſpoke of divers things in the myſtery of Contentment, and in the cloſe we ſpoke of two more, but we could not have time to open ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, I ſhall open them a little more largely, and then proceed to ſome few more, and ſo to other things in the point.</p>
               <p>That is the next thing, A Chriſtian heart hath not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in <hi>God</hi> (and certainly, he that hath God, muſt have all, he that hath him that hath all, he hath all) <hi>But he is able to make up all his outward wants of Creature-comforts from what he finds in himſelf:</hi> That may ſeem to be more ſtrange; It is true, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we may convince men though they do not feel by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience what it is to make up all in God, yet we may convince them that if they have him that hath all things, then they have all; for there is ſuch a fullneſs in God, he being the infinite firſt Being of all things that may make up all their wants.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132683:35"/>But here is another thing, that is further: I ſay, A Godiy man can make up whatſoever he wants without the creature, he can make it up in himſelf, in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 14. verſ. 14. A <hi>good man is ſatisfied in himſelf:</hi> as now, If he wants outward comforts, good chear, feaſting; a good Conſcience is a continual feaſt, he can make up the want of a feaſt by that peace he hath in his own Conſcience: if he wants melody abroad, he hath a bird within him that ſings the moſt meldious ſongs that are in the world, and the moſt delightful. And then, Doth he want honor? he hath his own Conſcience witneſſing for him, that is as a thouſand witneſſes, the Scripture ſaith in <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. verſe 21. <hi>Neither ſhall they ſay, Lo, here; or Lo, there: for behold the Kingdom of God is within you:</hi> A Chriſtian then whatſoever he wants he can make it up, for he hath a Kingdom in himſelf, the Kingdom of God is within him. If one that is a King ſhould meet with a great deal of trouble when he is abroad, yet he contents himſelf with this, I have a Kingdom of mine own; now here it is ſaid, the Kingdom of God is within a man, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon this Scripture of the Kingdom of God being within, thoſe that are learned, if they would but look into that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Goſpel that we have of a learned man, they ſhall find a very ſtrange conceit that he hath about this very Text, he confeſſes indeed it is inutterable; and ſo indeed it is: <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is within you:</hi> he makes it that there is ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God and Chriſt within the ſoul of a man, that when the body dies (he ſaith) that the ſoul goes into God and Chriſt that is within him; the Souls going into God and Chriſt, and enjoying of that communion with God and Chriſt that is within its ſelf, that is Heaven to it (ſaith he.) He confeſſes he is not able to expreſſe himſelf, nor others cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand fully what he intends; but certainly for the preſent before death, there is a Kingdom of God within the ſoul, ſuch a manifeſtation of God in the ſoul, that is enough to content the heart of a Godly man in the world, the Kingdom to content hath now within him, he ſhall not ſtay till afterwards, till he goes to Heaven; but certainly there is a Heaven in the ſoul of a Godly man, he hath Heaven already: Many times when you go to comfort your friends in their afflictions, you will ſay,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132683:35"/>Heaven will pay for all; nay, you may certainly find Heaven pays for all already: there is Heaven within the ſouls of the Saints, that is a certain truth, no ſoul ſhall ever come to Heaven, but that ſoul that hath Heaven come to it firſt. VVhen you die you hope you ſhall go to Heaven: But if you ſhall go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when you die, Heaven will come to you before you die. Now this is a great myſtery to have the Kingdom of Heaven in the ſoul, no man can know this but that ſoul that hath it; that Heaven which is within the ſoul for the preſent (I ſay) it is like the white ſtone and the new name, that none but thoſe that have it can underſtand it: It is a miſerable condition, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to depend upon creatures altogether for our Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; you know rich men account it a great happineſs, if they need not go to buy things by the penny as others do, they have all things for pleaſure or profit upon their own ground, and all their inheritance lyes entire together, they have no body comes within them, but they have all within themſelves, there lies their happineſs: whereas other poorer people are fain to go from one market to another to provide them neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, but yet great rich men they have Sheep and Beeves, Corn, and Clothing, and all things elſe of their own with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, and herein they place their happineſs: But this is the happineſs of a Chriſtian that he hath that within himſelf that may ſatisfie him more than all theſe; That place which we have in the firſt of <hi>James,</hi> ſeems to allude to that condition of men that have all their eſtates within themſelves; <hi>James</hi> 1.4. <hi>But let patience have her perfect work, that we may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing:</hi> the word there uſed ſignifies to have the whole inheritance to our ſelves, not a broken inheritance, but that where all lies within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as a man that hath not a piece of his eſtate here, and a piece there, but he hath it all lies together; and the heart being patient under afflictions, findes it ſelf to be in ſuch an eſtate as this is, finds his whole inheritance to be together, and all intire within its ſelf. And now ſtill to ſhew this by further ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes; it is with him being filled with good things, juſt like as it is with many a man that enjoys abundance of comforts at home at his own houſe, God grants to him a convenient ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:132683:36"/>a comfortable Yoke fellow, and fine Walks and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and hath all things at home that he could deſire; now this man cares not much for going abroad: other men are fain to go abroad to take the air, but he hath a ſweet air at home; and they are fain to go abroad to ſee friends, becauſe they have railings and contendings at home; many ill husbands will give this reaſon (if his wife make any moan and complaint of his ill husbandry) of their bad husbandry, and will make that their excuſe to go abroad, becauſe they can never be quiet at home. Now we account thoſe men moſt happy that have all at home; thoſe that have cloſe houſes that are unſavoury, and ſmells ill, they delight to go into the freſh air; but it is not ſo with many others, that have thoſe at home; thoſe that have no good clear at home, they are fain to go abroad to friends, but thoſe that have their tables furniſhed, they had as leive ſtay at home: So a carnal man, he hath but little Contentment in his own ſpirit; it is <hi>Auſtines</hi> ſimilitude, ſaith he, An ill conſcience is like a ſcoulding Wife; a man (ſaith he) that hath an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he cares not to look into his own ſoul, but loves to be abroad, and looks into other things, but never looks to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but one that hath a good conſcience, he delights in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his own heart, he hath a good conſcience within him: And ſo a carnal heart, becauſe there is nothing but filthyneſs, a filthy ſtink in himſelf, nothing but vileneſs and baſeneſs within him, upon this it is that he ſeeks his Contentment elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: and as it is with a veſſel that is full of Liquor, if you ſtrike upon it, it will make no great noiſe; but if it be empty, then it makes a great noiſe: So it is with the heart, An heart that is full of grace and goodneſs within, ſuch a one will bear a great many ſtroakes and never make any noiſe; but an empty heart, if that be ſtruck, that will make a noiſe; thoſe men and women that are ſo much complaining, and always whining, it is a ſign that there is an emptineſs in their hearts; but if their hearts were filled with Grace, they would not make ſuch a noiſe as now they do. As a man that hath his bones filled with Marrow, and veins filled with good blood, he complains not of cold as others do: ſo a gracious heart having the Spirit of God within him, and his heart filled with grace, he hath that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:132683:36"/>within him that makes him find Contentment. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Seneca,</hi> Indeed thoſe things that I ſuffer will be incredibly heavy when I cannot bear my ſelf: but now if I be no burden to my ſelf, if I have all quiet within mine own heart, then I can bear any thing: many men through their wickedneſs they have burdens without, but the greateſt burden is the wickedneſs of their own hearts, they are not burdened with their ſins in a godly way, that would caſe their burden, but they have ſtill their wickedneſs in the power of it, and ſo they are burdens to themſelves. The diſtempers of mens hearts are mighty bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to them; many times a godly man hath enough within to content him; Vertue it is content with its ſelf for to live well; (It is a ſpeech of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and it is in one of his Paradoxes) It finds enough within its own ſphere for the living happily: but how few are acquainted with this Myſtery? Many think, Oh if I had that that another man hath, how happily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably ſhould I live. Oh but if thou beeſt a Chriſtian, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thy condition be, yet thou haſt enough within thy ſelf. You will ſay ſuch and ſuch men that have all things, they need not be beholding to any body, you ſhall have many that will labor and take pains when they are young, that they might not be beholding to others, I love to live of my ſelf; now a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may do ſo; not that he doth not live upon God (I mean not ſo) but upon that which he hath of God within himſelf, that he can live upon, although he doth not enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that are without himſelf, that is it which I mean, and thoſe that are godly and keep cloſe to God in their communion with him, they underſtand what I mean by this, that a Chriſtian hath ſupply of all his wants within himſelf; and here you may ſee that the ſpirit of a Chriſtian is a precious ſpirit, a godly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is precious, why? becauſe it hath enough to make him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py within himſelf.</p>
               <p>The next thing that the Myſtery of Contentment conſiſts in, is this, <hi>That a gracious heart fetches ſupply of all from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ſo comes to have Contentment:</hi> which is a dry thing to a carnal ſpirit. Now there are two things here.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he fetches Contentment from the covenant in general, that is, from the great covenant that God hath made with him in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:132683:37"/>
Secondly, From the particular promiſes that God hath made with him in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the Covenant in general. I'le give you one Scripture for that, it is very remarkable, in the 2 of <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. verſ. 5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure: for this is all my Salvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> It is a moſt admirable Scripture of <hi>David,</hi> that yet had not the Covenant of Grace opened ſo fully as we have. But yet mark what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Although I find not my houſe ſo, that is, ſo comfortably every way as I would, although it be not ſo, what hath he to content his ſpirit? ſaith he, He hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant; this is that that helps all: I am not (may ſome men ſay) thus and thus with God, I do not find God come in ſo fully, or it is not with my houſe and family as I hoped it might be, perhaps there is this or that affliction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my houſe; ſuppoſe you ſhould have the Plague come into your houſe, and your houſe is not ſafe, and you have not that outward comfort in your houſe as formerly you had, but can you read this Scripture, and ſay, Although my houſe be not ſo bleſt with health as other mens houſes are; although my houſe be not ſo, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I am one yet in Covenant with God, the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant: as for theſe things in this world, I ſee they are but momentary, they are not ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, I ſee in a family when all was well but a week ago, now all is down, and the Plague hath ſwept away a great many of them, and the reſt are left in ſadneſs, and mourning: we ſee there is no truſting in the things of this world, yet the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting covenant ordered in all things: I find diſorder in my heart, in my family; but the everlaſting Covenant, that is ordered in all things; yea, and that is ſure; Alack, there is no ſureneſs here in theſe things, I can be ſure of nothing here, eſpecially in theſe times, we know that a man can be ſure of little that he hath, who can be ſure of his eſtate? perhaps ſome of you here that have lived well and comfortably before, and all was well about you, and you thought your mountain was ſtrong, but you ſee within a day or two all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:132683:37"/>away from you, ſo that there is no ſureneſs in the things of this world: But ſaith he, the Covenant is ſure: what I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Sea that is not ſure, but here is an Aſſurance Office in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, here is a great Aſſurance Office for the Saints, and they are not at charge, but only the exerciſing of Grace, for they may go to this Aſſurance Office to aſſure everything that they venture, either to have the thing it ſelf, or be paid for it: In an aſſurance Office you cannot be aſſured to have the very goods come in that you inſured, but if they be loſt the Inſurers do engage themſelves to make it good to you. And this Covenant of grace that God hath made with his people, it is Gods Aſſurance Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the Saints in all their fears may, and ought to go to the Covenant to aſſure all things to them, to aſſure their eſtates, and aſſure their lives. You will ſay, How are they ſure, their lives and eſtates go as well as others? But God engages himſelf to make up all; And then mark what follows, <hi>This is all my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> Why <hi>David,</hi> wilt thou not have ſalvation from thine Enemies and outward dangers, from peſtilence and plague? The frame of his ſpirit is quieted, as if he ſhould ſay, If that ſalvation comes, well and good, I ſhall praiſe God for it, but that that I have in the Covenant, that is my ſalvation, I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that as enough: Yea and then further, <hi>This is all my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all my deſire,</hi> VVhy <hi>David,</hi> is there not ſomthing elſe that thou wouldſt have beſides this Covenant? No ſaith he, It is all involved in this. Now ſurely thoſe men or women muſt needs live contented lives that have all their deſires; now ſaith the holy man here, this is all my deſire, <hi>And though he make it not to grow.</hi> But for all this Covenant perhaps you will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in the world as other men do: True, but I am at a point for that: Though God doth not make my houſe to grow, I have all my deſires.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how a Godly heart finds Contentment in the Covenant. Many of you ſpeak of the Covenant of God and of the Covenant of Grace, but have you found it ſo effectual to your ſouls? have you ſuckt this ſweetneſs from the Covenant and content to your hearts in your ſad condition? It is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſign of the truth of Grace in any ſoul, that when any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth befall him, in a kind of natural way, he doth preſently
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:132683:38"/>repair to the Covenant; juſt as a Childe as ſoon as ever it is in danger, you ſhall not need to tell him and ſay, when you are in danger you muſt go to your father or mother, nature tells him ſo: ſo it is with a gracious heart, as ſoon as it is in any trouble or affliction there is a new nature that doth carry him to the Covenant preſently, and there it finds eaſe and reſt: and if you find that your hearts do thus work, preſently to be running to the Covenant, it is an excellent ſign of the truth of grace: that is for the general.</p>
               <p>But now for particular promiſes in the Covenant of Grace. A gracious heart looks upon every promiſe as coming from the root of the great Covenant of Grace in Chriſt. Other men look upon ſome particular promiſes, that God will help them in ſtraights and keep them, and the like; but they look not upon the connexion of ſuch particular promiſes, to the root, the covenant of grace: Now Chriſtians do miſs of a great deal of comfort they might have from the particular promiſes in the Goſpel, if they would look upon their connexion to the root, the great Covenant that God hath made with them in Chriſt. Now I remember I ſpoke a little about that, that in outward promiſes in the time of the Law, they might reſt more upon them than we can in the time of the Goſpel. I gave you the reaſon why we that live in the time of the Goſpel cannot reſt ſo fully, for a literal performance of outward promiſes that we meet withall in the old Teſtament, as they might in the time of the Law: for there was a ſpecial Covenant that God pleaſed to call a new Covenant by way of diſtinction from the other Covenant that is made with us in Chriſt for eternal life: And ſo even the Law was given them in a more peculiar way for an external Covenant of outward bleſſings in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo God did deal with them in a more external Covenant than he doth now with his people. Yet godlineſs hath the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come. We may make uſe of the promiſes for this life, but yet not ſo much to reſt upon the literal performance of them as they might; but that God will make them good ſome way or other, in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual way, if not in an outward way. We muſt lay no more upon outward promiſes than this, and therefore if we will lay
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:132683:38"/>more we make the Promiſe to bear more than it will bear out. For to give ſome inſtance; To believe fully and confidently that the Plague ſhall not come nigh ſuch a houſe (I ſay) it is to lay more upon ſuch a promiſe than it will bear. I opened that promiſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. Now if I had lived in the time of the Law, perhaps I might have been ſomewhat more confident of the literal performance of the promiſe than I can now in the time of the Goſpel, the promiſe now bears no more than this, That God hath a ſpecial protection over his People, and that he will deliver them from the evil of ſuch an affliction; and if he doth bring ſuch an affliction, it is more then an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry providence. 'Tis ſome ſpecial providence that God hath in it. I had thought to have given you divers promiſes for the Contentment of the heart in the time of affliction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle upon thee.</hi> Certainly though this promiſe was made in the time of the Law, yet it will be made good to all the Saints now, one way or other, either in the letter or ſome other way. For ſo we find it plainly, that promiſe that was made to <hi>Joſhua, I will not fail thee nor forſake thee, Joſh.</hi> 1.5. It's applied to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the time of the Goſpel. So that here is the way of faith in bringing Contentment by the Promiſes, that all the Promiſes that ever were made to our forefathers, from the begining of the world, the Saints of God have an intereſt in them, they are their inheritances, and ſo goes on from one generation to another, and by that they come to have Contentment, becauſe they do inherit all the promiſes made in all the Book of God: So <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. ſhews plainly, that it is our inheritance, and we do not inherit leſs now than they did in <hi>Joſhua's</hi> time, but we inherit more, for you ſhall find in that place of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> there is more ſaid than is to <hi>Joſhua;</hi> to <hi>Joſhua</hi> God ſaith, He will not leave him, nor forſake him; now in that place of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in the Greek there is five negatives, <hi>I will not, not, not, not, not,</hi> again there is the elegancy of it very much, in the Greek I ſay there is five negatives in that little ſentence; as if God ſhould ſay, I will not leave you, no, I will not, I will not, I will not,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:132683:39"/>with ſuch earneſtneſs five times together: So that we have not only the ſame promiſes that they had, but we have them more enlarged and more full, though ſtill not ſo much in the literal ſenſe, for that indeed is the laſt part of the promiſe. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. there God made a promiſe, <hi>that no weapon formed againſt his people ſhould proſper, and everytongue that ſhall riſe againſt them in judgement thou ſhalt condemn</hi> (and mark what follows) <hi>this is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord, and their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is of me, ſaith the Lord:</hi> This is a good promiſe for Souldiers, though ſtill not to lay too much upon the literal ſenſe: True, it holds forth thus much, that Gods protection is in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner over Souldiers that are godly, <hi>And every tongue that ſhall riſe againſt thee in judgement, thou ſhalt condemn:</hi> and this is againſt falſe witneſs too: Oh you, that your friends never left you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, you will ſay, my friends died and left me not a groat, but I thank God, God hath provided for me; but though thy father or mother died and left thee no heritage, yet thou haſt a heritage in the promiſe, <hi>This is their heritage.</hi> So that ther's no Godly man or woman, but is a great Heir. Therefore when thou lookeſt into the Book of God, and findeſt any Promiſe there, thou mayeſt make that thine own. Juſt as an Heir that rides over divers fields and meadows, ſaith he, This meadow is my heritage, and this Corn-field is my heritage: and then he ſees a fair houſe, and ſaith he, this fair houſe is my heritage; and he looks upon them with another manner of eye than a ſtranger that ſhall ride over thoſe fields. So a carnal heart reads the Promiſes, and reads them but meerly as ſtories, not that they have any great intereſt in them: But a godly man eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time he reads the Scriptures (remember this Note when you are reading the Scripture) and there meeteth with a Promiſe, he ought to lay his hand upon it, and ſay, this is a part of my heritage, it's mine, and I am to live upon it, and this will make you to be contented. Here's a Myſterious way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. and 37.6. there's divers other Promiſes that brings Contentment. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.10. And thus much for the Myſtery of Contentment by way of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>There is two or three things more that ſhew how a Godly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:132683:39"/>man hath Contentment after another kind of way than any Carnal heart in the world hath, it's a Myſterious way, as thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath Contentment by reallizing the glorious things of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him,</hi> he hath the Kingdom of Heaven as preſent, and the glory that is to come, by faith he makes it as preſent, So the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs they had Contentment in their ſufferings, for ſaid ſome of them. Though we have but a hard breakfaſt, yet we ſhall have a good dinner, we ſhall preſently be in Heaven, do but ſhut your eyes (ſaith one) and you ſhall be in Heaven preſently. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>We faint not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) Why? <hi>Becauſe theſe light afflictions that are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> They ſee Heaven before them and that contents them. You Mariners when you can ſee the Haven before you, though you were mightily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before you could ſee any land, yet when you come nigh the ſhore and can ſee a land-mark, that contents you exceedingly; a godly man in the middeſt of the waves and ſtorms that he meets withall, he can ſee the Glory of Heaven before him, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf; one drop of the ſweetneſs of Heaven is enough to take away all the ſour and bitter of all the afflictions in the world: Indeed here we know that one drop of ſour, or one drop of gall will make bitter a great deal of honey, put a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Sugar into a cup of gall or wormwood, that will not ſweeten it, but if you put a ſpoonful of gall into a cup of Sugar it will imbitter that; now it's otherwiſe in Heaven, one drop of ſweet will ſweeten a great deal of ſour affliction, but a great deal of ſour and gall will not imbitter a ſoul that ſees the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven that is to come: now a carnal heart hath no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment but from what he ſees before him in this world, but a godly heart hath Contentment from that that he ſees laid up for him in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing that I would name, is this, <hi>A godly man hath Contentment by opening and letting out of his heart to God:</hi> other men or women they are diſcontented, but how do they help themſelves? by railing, by ill language, ſuch an one croſſes them, and they have no way to help themſelves but by railing, and by bitter words, and ſo they eaſe themſelves that way, when they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:132683:40"/>are angry, but a godly man when he is croſs't, how doth he eaſe himſelf? he is ſenſible of his croſs as well as you, and he goes to God in Prayer, and there opens his heart to God, and lets out his ſorrows and fears, and then can come away with a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countenance; now do you find that you can come away from prayer and not look ſad? As it's ſaid (in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18.) of <hi>Hannah,</hi> that when ſhe had been at prayer her countenance was no more ſad, there ſhe was comforted; and this is the right way of Contentment. Thus we have done with the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Contentment. Now if you can put theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that we have ſpoken of, you may ſee fully what an Art Chriſtian Contentment is; <hi>Paul</hi> had need learn it; you ſee Contentment is not ſuch a poor buſineſs as many make it, to ſay you muſt be content, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is a great Art and Myſtery of Godlineſs to be contented in the way of a Chriſtian, and it will appear yet further to be a Myſtery, when we come to the Third Head; and that's to ſhew what thoſe leſſons are that a gracious heart doth learn when it learns to be contented, I have learn'd to be contented: <hi>Learn'd,</hi> What Leſſons have you learn'd? As now a Scholar that hath great learning and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in Arts and Sciences, how did he begin it? he began (as we uſe to ſay) his ABC. and then afterwards he came to his Teſtament, and Bible, and Accidence, and ſo to his Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and afterwards to his other Books; ſo he learn'd one thing after another: So a Chriſtian coming to Contentment is as a Scholar in Chriſts School, and there are divers Leſſons to teach the ſoul to bring it to this learning: every godly man or woman is a Scholar, it cannot be ſaid of any Chriſtian that he is illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but he is literate; a learned man, a learned woman: now the leſſons that Chriſt teaches, to bring us to Contentment, are theſe:</p>
               <p>The firſt great leſſon is, The leſſon of <hi>Self-denial:</hi> and though it be a great and hard leſſon; as you know a childe at firſt cries, It's hard, It's that that I remember <hi>Bradford</hi> the Martyr ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever hath not learned the Leſſon of the Croſſe, hath not learned his ABC in Chriſtianity.</hi> Here Chriſt begins with his Scholars, yea thoſe in the loweſt form muſt begin with this; if you mean to be Chriſtians all, you muſt buckle to this or you
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:132683:40"/>can never be Chriſtians: There is none can be a Scholar except be doth learn his <hi>ABC:</hi> ſo thou muſt learn the leſſon of ſelf-denial or thou canſt never come to be a Scholar in Chriſts School, to be learned in this Myſtery of contentment: That is the firſt leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Chriſt teaches any ſoul: Oh ſelf denial, that brings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, that brings down &amp; ſoftens a mans heart: a thing (you know) that is ſoft, if you ſtrike upon it, it makes no noiſe, but if you ſtrike upon a hard thing it makes a noiſe; ſo the hearts of men that are full of themſelves, and hardened with ſelf love, if they have any ſtroke they make a noiſe; but a ſelf-denying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian yeilds to Gods hand, and makes no noiſe; as when you ſtrike upon a Wool-ſack it makes no noiſe, becauſe it yeilds to the ſtroke; ſo a ſelf-denying heart yeilds to the ſtroke, and thereby comes to this contentment. Now in this leſſon of ſelf-denial there are divers things: I will not enter into the doctrine of ſelf-denial, but only ſhew you how Chriſt teaches ſelf-denial, and how that brings Contentment.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such a one learns to know that he is nothing;</hi> he comes to this, to be able to ſay, Well, I ſee I am nothing in my ſelf, now that man or woman which indeed knows that he or ſhe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and hath learned it throughly, will be able to bear any thing: The way to be able to bear any thing, is to know our ſelves to be nothing in our ſelves. Saith God to us, <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine heart upon that which is nothing?</hi> Prov. 23.5. ſpeaking of riches; why bleſſed God, doſt not thou do ſo? thou haſt ſet thy heart upon us, and yet we are nothing. God would not have us ſet our hearts upon riches becauſe they are nothing, and yet God is pleaſed to ſet his heart upon us, and yet we are nothing, that is Gods Grace, free grace, and therefore it is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what I ſuffer, for I am as nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I deſerve nothing.</hi> I am nothing, and I deſerve nothing, ſuppoſe I have not this and that that others have, I am ſure I deſerve nothing except it be Hell; you will anſwer any of your ſervants, ſo that is not content, I marvel what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? or your children, Do you deſerve it, that you are ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon it? you think to ſtop their mouths thus; ſo we may eaſily ſtop our own mouths, we deſerve nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould we be impatient if we have not what we deſire,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:132683:41"/>if we had deſerved any thing, we might have ſome trouble of ſpirit, as a man that hath deſerved well of the State, or of his friends, and he finds not anſwerable encouragement, it troubles him mightily, but if he be conſcious to himſelf that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved nothing, he is content with a repulſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>I can do nothing. Without me you can do nothing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. Why ſhould I ſtand much upon it, to be troubled and be diſcontented if I have not this or that, when the truth is, I can do nothing? If you ſhould come to one that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry becauſe he hath not ſuch diet as he deſires, and is diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, you will anſwer him, I marvel what you do, what uſe are you of? Shall one that will ſit ſtill and be of no uſe, yet for all that he muſt have all his ſupply that poſſible he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? Do but conſider of what uſe you are in the world; if you conſider what little need God hath of you, and what little uſe you are of, you will not be much diſcontented: If you have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this leſſon of ſelf-denial, though God doth cut me ſhort of ſuch and ſuch comforts, yet ſince that I do but little, why ſhould I have much? This very thought will bring down a mans ſpirit as much as any thing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>So vile I am, that I can receive no good neither of my ſelf;</hi> I am not only an empty veſſel, but a corrupt and unclean veſſel that would ſpoil any thing that comes into it: So are all our hearts, every one of our hearts is not onely empty of good, but are like a muſty veſſel, that if any good liquor be poured into it, it ſpoils it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If God doth cleanſe us in ſome meaſure, and doth put into us ſome good liquor, ſome Grace of his ſpirit, yet, <hi>We can make uſe of nothing, neither can we have it, if God doth but withdraw himſelf:</hi> If God doth but leave us one moment, after he hath beſtowed upon us the greateſt gifts, and whatſoever abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities we can deſire, If God ſhould ſay, I will give you them, now go and trade, now I have given you theſe and theſe abilities, we cannot ſtir one foot further neither if God doth but leave us. Doth God give us gifts and parts? Then let us fear and tremble leſt God ſhould leave us to our ſelves, for then how foully ſhould we abuſe thoſe gifts and parts? You think other men and women have memory, and gifts, and parts, and you would fain
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:132683:41"/>have them. But ſuppoſe God ſhould give you theſe, and there leave you, you would utterly ſpoil them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>We are worſe than nothing,</hi> For by ſin we come to be a great deal worſe than nothing; ſin makes us more vile than nothing, ſin makes us contrary to all good: now it is a great deal worſe to have a contrariety to all that is good, than meerly to have an emptineſs of all that is good; we are not empty pitchers in reſpect of good, but we are like pitchers filled with poyſon, and is it much for ſuch as we are to be cut ſhort of outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts?</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh place, <hi>If we periſh, there will be no loſs of us.</hi> If God ſhould annihilate me, what loſs would there be of me? God can raiſe up another in my place, to do him other manner of ſervice than I have done. Now put but theſe ſeven thing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and then hath Chriſt taught you ſelf-denial: I may call theſe the ſeveral words in our leſſon of ſelf-denial, Chriſt reaches the ſoul this, ſo that as in the preſence of God upon a real ſight of it ſelf it can ſay Lord I am nothing, Lord I deſerve nothing, Lord I can do nothing, I can receive nothing, I can make uſe of nothing, I am worſe than nothing, and if I come to nothing and periſh, there will be no loſs at all of me, and therefore what great matter is it for me to be cut ſhort here? A man that is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in his own eyes, ſuch a man or woman will account every affliction to be little, and every mercy to be great: <hi>Saul,</hi> There was a time (the Scripture ſaith) that he was little in his own eyes, and then his afflictions were but little to him, when ſome would not have had him to be King, but ſpake contemptuouſly of him, he held his peace, but when <hi>Saul</hi> began to be big in his own eyes, then the affliction began to be great upon him. <hi>There was never any ſuch contented man or woman as this ſelf-denying man or woman:</hi> There was never any denied himſelf ſo much as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did, he gave his cheeks to the ſmiters, he opened not his mouth, he was as a lamb when he was led to the ſlaughter, he made no noiſe in the ſtreet: Oh he denyed himſelf above all, and was willing to empty himſelf; and ſo he was the moſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ever any was in the world, and the neerer we come to learn to deny our ſelves as Chriſt did, the more contented ſhall we be, and by knowing much of our own vileneſs, we come to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:132683:42"/>learn to juſtifie God, whatever the Lord ſhall lay upon us, yet righteous is the Lord, for he hath to deal with a moſt wretched creature. A diſcontented heart he is troubled becauſe he hath no more comfort; but one that is a ſelf-denying man, he rather wonders that he hath ſo much as he hath: Oh ſaith one, I have but a little; I, but ſaith he that hath learned his leſſon of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, I rather wonder that God beſtows upon me the liberty of breathing in the air, knowing how vile I am, and knowing how much ſin the Lord doth ſee in me: and that is the way of contentment, by learning ſelf-denial.</p>
               <p>Eightly, There is a further thing in ſelf-denial which brings contentment. <hi>Becauſe thereby the ſoul comes to rejoyce and take ſat is faction in all Gods ways</hi> (I beſeech you obſerve this) If a man be ſelfiſh and have ſelf-love prevail in his heart, thoſe things that ſuits with his own ends he will be glad of them; but a godly man that hath denied himſelf he will ſuit with, and be glad of all things that ſhall ſuit with Gods ends: Saith a Gracious heart, Gods ends are my ends; and I have denyed mine own ends, and ſo he comes to find contentment in all Gods ends and ways, and his comforts are multiplied, whereas the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of other men are ſingle, it is but very rare that Gods ways ſhall ſuit with a mans particular ends, but always Gods ways ſuit with his own ends; now if you will only have contentment when Gods ways ſuit with his own ends, you can have it but now and then, but a ſelf-denying man denies his own ends and only looks at the ends of God, and therein is contented: When a man is ſelfiſh he cannot but have a great deal of trouble and vexation, for if I regard my ſelf, my ends are ſo narrow that I ſhall have a hundred things will come and juſtle me, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have room in thoſe narrow ends of mine own; as you know in the City what a deal of ſtir there is in the narrow ſtreets, as <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet being ſo narrow they juſtle and wrangle and fight one with another, becauſe the place is ſo narrow, but now in the broad ſtreets there they can go quietly; ſo men that are ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, they meet and ſo juſtle one with another, one man is for ſelf in one thing, and another man is for ſelf in another thing, and ſo they make a great deal of ſtir; but thoſe whoſe hearts are inlarged and make publike things their ends, and can deny
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:132683:42"/>themſelves, they can walk at breadth and never juſtle one with another ſo as the other do. The leſſon of ſelf-denial is the firſt Leſſon that Jeſus Chriſt doth learn men in the ſeeking of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Leſſon is, <hi>The vanity of the Creature:</hi> That is, the ſecond Leſſon in Chriſts School, that he teaches thoſe that he would make Scholars in this Art: The vanity of the Creature, That whatſoever there is in the Creature hath an emptineſs in it, <hi>Vanity of vanities, that all is vanity;</hi> that is the leſſon the Wiſe man learned, that the creature in its ſelf, can do us neither good nor hurt, but it is all but as a wind, there is nothing in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is ſutable to a gracious heart to feed upon for the good and happineſs of it: My Brethren, the reaſon why you have not Contentment in the things of the world, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not enough of them, that is not the reaſon, but the reaſon is, becauſe they are not things proportionable to that immortal ſoul of yours that are capable of God himſelf; many men think when they are troubled and have not Contentment, that it is becauſe they have but a little in the world, and if they had more, then they ſhould be content: That were juſt thus, Suppoſe a man is an hungry, and to ſatisfie his craving ſtomach he ſhould gape and hold open his mouth, to take in the wind, and then ſhould think the reaſon why he is not ſatisfied, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not enough of the wind; no, the reaſon is, becauſe the thing is not ſutable to a craving ſtomach; Truly there is the ſame madneſs in the world; the wind that a man takes in by gaping, will as ſoon ſatisfie a craving ſtomach which is ready to famiſh, as all the comforts in the world can ſatisfie a ſoul that knows what true happineſs means. You would be happy, and you ſeek after ſuch and ſuch comforts in the creature: well, have you got them? do you find your heart ſatisfied as having that happineſs that is ſutable to you? No, no, it is not here, but you think it is, becauſe you want ſuch and ſuch things: O poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded man! It is not becauſe you have not enough of it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the thing that is proportionable to that immortal ſoul that God hath given you. <hi>Why do you lay out your money for that which is not bread</hi> (Iſa. 55.2.) <hi>and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> You are mad people, you ſeek to ſatisfie
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:132683:43"/>your ſtomachs with that that is not bread, you follow the wind, you will never have Contentment, all the creatures in the world ſay, Contentment is not in us, riches ſaith Contentment is not in me, pleaſure ſaith Contentment is not in me, if you look for Contentment in the creature you will fail: No, Contentment is higher: when thou comeſt into the School of Chriſt, Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thee that there is a vanity in all things in the world, and the ſoul that by coming into the School of Chriſt, by underſtanding the glorious myſteries of the Goſpel, comes to ſee the vanity of all things in the world, that is the ſoul that comes to true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. I could tell you of abundance of ſentences from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that ſhews the vanity of all things in the world, and yet they did not learn the vanity of the creature in the right School. But now when a ſoul comes into the School of Jeſus Chriſt, and there comes to ſee a vanity in all things in the world, then ſuch a ſoul comes to have Contentment. If you ſeek Contentment elſewhere, you do like the unclean ſpirit, ſeek for reſt but find none.</p>
               <p>A third Leſſon that Chriſt teaches a Chriſtian when he comes into his School, is this: <hi>He learns him to underſtand what that One thing is that is neceſſary, which he never came to understand before:</hi> you know what he ſaith to <hi>Martha, O</hi> Martha, <hi>thou cumbreſt thy ſelf about many things, but there is one thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> The ſoul before ſought after this and the other thing, but now ſaith the ſoul, I ſee really that it is not neceſſary that I ſhould be rich, but it is neceſſary that I ſhould make up my peace with God: it is not neceſſary that I ſhould live a pleaſurable life in this world, but it is abſolutely neceſſary that I ſhould have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of my ſin; it is not neceſſary that I ſhould have honor and preferment, but it is neceſſary that I ſhould have God to be my portion, and have my part in Jeſus Chriſt; it is neceſſary that my ſoul ſhould be ſaved in the day of Jeſus Chriſt: the other things are pretty fine things indeed, and I ſhould be glad if God would give them me, a fine habitation, and comings in, and cloathes, and promotion for my wife and children, theſe are comfortable things, but theſe are not the neceſſary things, I may have theſe and yet periſh for ever, but the other is abolutely neceſſary; no matter though I be poor, ſo be it I may have that that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:132683:43"/>neceſſary; thus Chriſt inſtructs the ſoul. There is many of you have had ſome thoughts about this that it is indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for you to provide for your ſoul, but when you come into Chriſts School, there Chriſt cauſes the fear of eternity to fall upon you, and there he cauſes ſuch a real ſight of the great things of eternity, and the abſolute neceſſity of thoſe things, that poſſeſſes your hearts with fear, and that takes you off from all other things in the world. Now I ſhould have ſhewn you how that will bring Contentment to the ſoul when it comes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the thing that is abſolutely neceſſary, but thus much for this time.</p>

               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that when he was to carry corn to <hi>Rome</hi> in time of dearth, he was in a great deal of danger by ſtorms at Sea, but ſaith he, We muſt go on, it is neceſſary that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be relieved, but it is not neceſſary that we ſhould live.

But now a man that hath buſineſs of great weight and conſequence, if all things go well with his great buſineſs that is in his head, he is not ſenſible of meaner things in the family; but now a man that lies at home and hath nothing to do, he finds fault with every thing: So it is with the heart; when the heart of a man hath no thing to do but to be buſie about Creature comforts, every little thing troubles him; but now, when the heart is taken up with the weighty things of Eternity, the great things of eternal life, the heart being taken up with them, theſe things that are here below, that did diſquiet it before, are things now of no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with him, in compariſon to the other, ſo as how things fall out here is not much regarded, with him, if the <hi>One thing that is Neceſſary be provided for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth leſſon that the ſoul is inſtructed in to come to this knowledge in the Art of Contentment, is this: <hi>The ſoul comes to underſtand, in what relation it ſtands in here to the world:</hi> by that I mean thus, <hi>God comes to inſtruct the ſoul effectually through Chriſt by his Spirit, upon what terms it lives here in the world, in what relation it is that it doth ſtand:</hi> as thus, While I live in the World my condition is to be but a pilgrime, a ſtranger, a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, &amp; a ſouldier: Now the right underſtanding of this, and being taught this, not only by rote, that I can ſpeak the words over, but when I come indeed to have my ſoul poſſeſt with the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this Truth, That God hath ſet me in this world, not as in my home, but as a meer ſtranger and a pilgrime, that I am travelling here to another home, and that I am here a ſouldier in my warfare; it is a mighty help to Contentment in whatſoever befalls one: as now to inſtance in all theſe conditions, When a man is at home, if he hath not things according to his deſire he will be finding fault, and is not contented; but if a mantra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels abroad, perhaps he meets not with conveniencies as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the ſervants in the houſe are not at his beck, or are not ſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:132683:44"/>diligent as his own ſervants were, and his diet is not as at home, and his bed not as at home, yet this very thought may moderate a mans ſpirit, I am a Traveller, and I muſt not be finding fault, I am but in another mans houſe, and it were not manners for one to find fault when he is abroad in another bodies family, though things be not ſo as in my own family; If a man meets with ill weather he muſt be content; it is Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers fare (we uſe to ſay) both fair weather and foul weather, this is the common Travellers fare, and we muſt be content with it; but if a man were at home and it ſhould drop down in his houſe, he would account it an ill thing, an affliction to him, and he cannot bear it: but when he is travelling abroad, though he meet with rain and ſtorms he is not ſo much troubled: When you are abroad at Sea, though you have not thoſe many things that you have at home, you are not troubled at it, you are contented; Why? you are abroad at Sea, you are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at ſtorms that do ariſe, and though you have many things otherwiſe than you would have them at home, but ſtill you are quieted with that, you are at Sea. Marriners when they are at Sea they care not what cloaths they have then, though they be pitch'd and tar'd, and but a clout about their necks, and any mean cloaths, but they think when they come home, then they ſhall have their fine ſilk ſtocking, and brave ſuits, and lac'd bands and ſuch things, and ſhall be very fine; and ſo they are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abroad upon that thought, that it ſhall be otherwiſe with them when they come home, and though they have nothing but ſalt meat, and a little hard fare, yet when they come to their houſes, then they ſhall have any thing: Thus it ſhould be with us in this world: the truth is, we are all in this world but as Sea-faring men, toſt up and down on the waves of the Sea of this world, and our Haven is Heaven, and we are here travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but our home it is another world, that long home. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome men have better accommodations than others have in travelling: it's true, it's a great mercy of God to us in <hi>England</hi> in that we can travel with ſuch delight and accommodations more than they can in other Countries; and through Gods mercy we have as great accommodation in our travelling to Heaven in <hi>England</hi> as any place under Heaven hath, but yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:132683:45"/>though we do meet with travellers fare ſomtimes, yet it ſhould not be grievous to us: The Scripture tells us plainly that we muſt behave our ſelves here but as pilgrims and ſtrangers. In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, abſtain from fleſhly luſts, which war againſt the ſoul:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what your condition is, you are pilgrims and ſtrangers, do not think to ſatisfie your ſelves here. A man when he comes into an Inn, If there be a fair cupbord of plate he is not troubled that it is not his own. Why? Becauſe he is going away; ſo let us not be troubled when we ſee other men have great eſtates, but we have not, Why? we are going away, into another Country, you are lodging here but as it were for a night, if you ſhould live an hundred years in compariſon of eternity, it is not ſo much as a night, it is but as you were travelling, and were come into an Inn: And were not this a madneſs for a man to be diſcontent becauſe he hath not what he ſees there, ſeeing it may be he is to go away again within half a quarter of an hour? So you find it in <hi>David,</hi> this was the argument that brought off <hi>Davids</hi> heart from the things of this world, and ſet him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other manner of things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.19. <hi>I am a ſtranger in the earth, hide not thy Commandements from me:</hi> I am a ſtranger in the earth (what then) then Lord let me have the knowledge of thy Commandements and it's ſufficient, as for the things of the earth I ſtand not upon them whether I have much or little, but hide not thy Commandements from me, Lord let me know the rule that I ſhould guide my life by.</p>
               <p>Again, We are not only Travellers but Souldiers, this is the condition of the life in which we are here in this world, and therefore we are to behave our ſelves accordingly. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes uſe of this argument in writing unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Thou therefore endure hardneſs as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The very thought of the condition of a man that is a Souldier, doth ſtill his diſquiet of heart: when he is abroad, he hath not that accommodations in his quarters as he hath in his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; perhaps a man that had his bed warm and curtains drawn about him, and all accommodations in his chamber; now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomtimes he muſt be put to lie upon ſtraw, and he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with himſelf, I am a Souldier, and it is ſutable to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:132683:45"/>he muſt have his bed warm'd at home, but he muſt lie abroad in the fields when he is a Souldier; and the very thought of this condition in which he ſtands, quiets him in all things, yea, and he goes rejoycing, to think, this is but ſutable to my condition in which God hath put me: ſo it ſhould be with us in reſpect of this world. Now, would it not be an unſeemly thing to ſee a Soldier go whining up &amp; down with the finger in the eye, and complaining, that he hath not hot meat every meal, and his bed warm'd as he had at home; Now Chriſtians they know that they are in their warfare, they are here in this world fighting and combating with the enemies of their ſouls and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condition, and they muſt be willing to endure hardneſs here. The right underſtanding of this, that God hath put them into ſuch a condition, it is that that will content them, eſpecially when they conſider that they are certain of the victory, and that ere long they ſhall triumph with Jeſus Chriſt, and then all their ſorrows ſhall be done away, &amp; their tears wiped from their eys. A Souldier is content to endure hardneſs, though he knows not that he ſhall have the victory? but a Chriſtian knows himſelf to be a Souldier, and knows that he ſhall conquer and triumph with Jeſus Chriſt to all eternity. And that's the fourth Leſſon that Chriſt doth teach the ſoul when he brings it into his School, to learn the Art of Contentment, he makes him underſtand throughly the relation in which he hath placed him in, in this world.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Leſſon that Chriſt teaches, it is this, <hi>He teacheth us wherein conſiſts any good that is to be enjoyed in any creature in the world.</hi> It's true, before it hath been taught that there is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Creature; that is, take the Creature conſidered in it's ſelf, but yet though there be a vanity in the Creature in it's ſelf, in reſpect of ſatisfying the ſoul for its portion, yet there is ſome goodneſs in the Creature, though there be a vanity, there is ſome deſirableneſs: But wherein doth that conſiſt? It conſiſts not in the nature of the Creature it ſelf, for that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity; but it conſiſts in the reference it hath to the firſt being of all things. This is a Leſſon that Chriſt teaches, If there be any good in an eſtate, or in any comforts in this world, it is not ſo much that it pleaſes my ſenſe, that it is ſutable to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:132683:46"/>my body, but the reference it hath to God the Firſt being, that by theſe creatures there ſhould be ſomwhat of Gods Goodneſs conveyed to me, and I may have a ſanctified uſe of the creature to draw me neerer to God, and that I enjoy more of God, and be made more ſerviceable for the Glory of God in the place where God hath ſet me, here's the good of the Creature; Oh were we but inſtructed in this Leſſon, did we but underſtand, and throughly believe this to be a truth, that there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all the world hath any goodneſs in it any further than it hath reference to the firſt infinite Supream Good of all, that ſo far as I can enjoy God in it, ſo far it is good to me, and ſo far as I do not enjoy God in it, ſo far there is no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in any thing that I have in the creature: how eaſie were it then for one to be contented; As thus, Suppoſe a man had a great eſtate but a few years ago, and now it is all gone, I would but appeal to this man, When you had your eſtate, wherein did you account the good of that eſtate to conſiſt? a carnal heart would ſay, any body might know that; that it brought me inſo much a year, and that I could fare of the beſt, and be a man of repute in the place where I live, and men would regard what I ſaid, I might be cloathed as I would, and lay up porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for my children, in this conſiſted the good of my eſtate; this man now never came into the School of Chriſt to know wherein the good of an eſtate did conſiſt, no marvail if he be diſquieted when he hath loſt his eſtate: But now a Chriſtian that hath been in the School of Chriſt, and hath been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Art of contentment, when ſuch a one hath an eſtate, he thinks, in that I have an eſtate above my brethren, in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the good of it to me, in that I have an opportunity to ſerve God the better, and I enjoy a great deal of Gods mercy to my Soul conveyed to me through the creature, and hereby I am enabled to do a great deal of good, and therein I account the good of my eſtate. Now God hath taken this away from me; now if God will be pleaſed to make up the enjoyment of himſelf another way; that is, will call me to honor him by ſuffering, and if I may do God as much Service now in my way of ſuffering, that is, to ſhew forth the Grace of his Spirit in the way of my ſuffering as I did in the way of proſperity, I
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:132683:46"/>have as much of God as I had before; if I may be led to God in my low condition, as much as I was in my proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have as much Comfort and Contentment as I had before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>Its true, If I could honor God in my low eſtate as much as in my proſperous estate, then it were ſomwhat; but how can that be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt know, the ſpecial honor that God hath from his Creatures in this world, it is, The manifeſtation of the Graces of his Spirit; It's true, God hath a great deal of honor when a man is in a publike place, and ſo he is able to do a great deal of good, To countenance Godlineſs, and diſcountenance Sin; but the main thing is, <hi>In our ſhewing forth the vertues of him that hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> Now if I can ſay, That through Gods mercy in my affliction I find the Graces of Gods Spirit working as ſtrongly in me as ever they did when I had my eſtate, I am where I was, yea, I am fully in as good a condition, for I have that good now that I had in my proſperous eſtate, for I accounted the good of it, but in my enjoyment of God, and honoring of God, and now God hath bleſt the want of it to ſtir up the Graces of his Spirit in my Soul, and this is the work that now God calls me to; and I muſt account God is moſt honored when I do the work that he calls me to; He ſets me a work in my proſperous eſtate at that time, to honor him in this condition: and now he ſets me awork at this time, to honor him in this condition: Now God is moſt honored, when I can turn from one condition to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, according as he calls me to it: Would you account your ſelves to be honored by your ſervants, when you ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a work that hath ſome excellency, and they will go on, and on, and you cannot get them off from it? Now let the work be never ſo good, yet if you will call them off to another work, you do expect that they ſhould manifeſt ſo much reſpect to you, as to be content to come off from that, though they be ſet about a meaner work, if it be more ſutable to your ends. So, you were in a proſperous eſtate, and there God called you to ſome ſervice that you took ſome pleaſure in; but ſuppoſe God ſaith, I will uſe you in a ſuffering condition, and I will have you honor me in that way; now here's the honoring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:132683:47"/>of God that you can turn this way or that way, as God calls you to it; thus now you having learned this, That the good of the Creature conſiſts in the enjoyment of God in it, and the honoring of God by it, you can be content, becauſe you have the ſame good that you had before. And that's the Fifth Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Leſſon that Chriſt doth teach the ſoul that he brings into this School, is this; <hi>He doth inſtruct ſuch a man or woman in the knowledge of their own hearts:</hi> you muſt learn this or you will never learn Contentment; you muſt learn to know your own hearts well, to be good Students of your own hearts; you cannot all be Scholars in the Arts and Sciences in the world, but you may all be Students in your own hearts; you cannot read in the book (many of you) but God expects that every day you ſhould turn over a leaf in your own hearts; you will never come to get any skill in this Myſtery, except you ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the book of your own hearts: Marriners, they have their books that they ſtudy, thoſe that will be good Navigators; and Scholars they have their books; thoſe that ſtudy Logick, they have their books according to that; and thoſe that would ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Rethorick and Philoſophy have their books according to that; and thoſe that ſtudy Divinity, they have their books whereby they come to be helped in the Study of Divinity: but a Chriſtian (next to the Book of God) is to look into the book of his own heart, and to read over that, and this will help you to Contentment theſe three ways:
<list>
                     <item>1. By the ſtudying of thy heart, thou wilt come preſently to <hi>diſcover wherein thy diſcontent lies;</hi> when thou art diſcontented thou wilt find out the root of any diſcontentment if thou doeſt ſtudy thy heart well: many men and women they are diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the truth is they know not wherefore, they think this and the other thing is the cauſe, but a man or woman that knows their own heart, they will find out preſently where the root of their diſcontent lies, that it lies in ſuch a corruption, and diſtemper of my heart, that now through Gods mercy I have found out; It is in this caſe as it is with a little childe that is very froward in the houſe, if a ſtranger comes in he doth not know what the matter is, perhaps the ſtranger will give the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:132683:47"/>Childe a Rattle, or a Nut, or ſuch a thing to quiet it, but when the Nurſe comes ſhe knows the temper and diſpoſition of the Childe, and therefore knows beſt how to quiet it: So it is here juſt thus for all the world, when we are ſtrangers with our own hearts we are mightily diſcontented, and know not how to quiet our ſelves, becauſe we know not wherein the diſquiet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And indeed when we are ſtrangers to our own hearts we cannot tell how to quiet our ſelves, but if we be very well verſed in our own hearts, when any thing falls out ſo as to diſquiet us, we find out the cauſe of it preſently, and ſo quickly come to be quiet. So a man that hath a Watch, and he underſtands the uſe of every wheel and pin, if it goes amiſs he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently find out the cauſe of it; but one that hath no skill in a Watch, when it goes amiſs he knows not what the matter is, and therefore cannot mend it. So indeed our hearts are as a Watch, and there are many wheels, and windings and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings there, and we ſhould labour to know our hearts well, that when they are out of tune we may know what the matter is.</item>
                     <item>2. This knowledge of our hearts will help us to Contentment, becauſe by this <hi>We ſhall come to know what is moſt ſutable to our condition.</hi> As thus, A man that knows not his own heart, he thinks not what need he hath of affliction, and upon that he is diſquieted; but that man or woman that hath ſtudied their own hearts, when God comes with afflictions upon them, they can ſay, I would not for any thing in the world have been without this affliction, God hath ſo ſuted this affliction to my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hath come in ſuch a way, that if this affliction had not come, I am afraid I ſhould have fallen into ſin: A poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man that takes Phyſick, the Phyſick works, and he thinks it will kill him, becauſe he knows not the ill humors that are in his body, and therefore he underſtands not how ſutable the Phyſick is to him; but a Phyſician takes a Purge, and it makes him extreamly ſick, ſaith the Phyſician, I like this the better, it doth but work upon the humor that I know is the cauſe of my diſeaſe, and upon that ſuch a man that hath knowledge and underſtanding of his body, and the cauſe of his diſtemper, he is not troubled or diſquieted; So would we be if we did but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:132683:48"/>know the diſtempers of our own hearts; Carnal men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they know not their own ſpirits, and therefore they fling and vex upon every affliction that doth befall them, they know not what diſtempers are in their hearts, that may be healed by their afflictions, if it pleaſe God to give them a ſanctified uſe of them.</item>
                     <item>3. By knowing their own hearts, <hi>they know what they are able to mannage,</hi> and by this meanes they come to be content; the Lord (perhaps) takes away many comforts from them that they had before, or denies them ſome things that they hoped to have got; now they by knowing their hearts, know this, That they were not able to manage ſuch an eſtate; and they were not able to manage ſuch proſperity, God ſaw it, and (ſaith a poor ſoul) I am in ſome meaſure convinc'd, by looking into mine own heart, that I was not able to manage ſuch a condition. A man deſires greedily to gripe more perhaps than he is able to manage, and ſo undoes himſelf: As Country men do obſerve, that if they do over-ſtock their Land, it will quickly ſpoyl them; and ſo a wiſe Husband-man that knows how much his ground will bear, he is not troubled that he hath not ſo much ſtock as others, why? becauſe he knows he hath not ground enough for ſo great a ſtock, and that quiets him: So many men and women that know not their own hearts, they would fain have a proſperous eſtate as others have, but if they knew their own hearts, they would know that they were not able to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it: If one of your little Children of three or four years old ſhould be crying for the coat of her that is twelve or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, and ſay, Why may not I have a coat as long as my Siſters? If ſhe had, it would ſoon trip up her heels, and break her face; but when the childe comes to underſtanding, ſhe is not diſcontented becauſe her coat is not ſo long as her Siſters, but ſaith, my coat is fit for me, and therein takes content: So if we come to underſtanding in the School of Chriſt we will not cry, Why have not I ſuch an eſtate as others have? the Lord ſees that I am not able to mannage it, and I ſee it my ſelf by the knowing of mine own heart. You ſhall have children, if they ſee but a Knife, they will cry for it, becauſe they know not their ſtrength, and that they are not able to mannage it, but you
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:132683:48"/>know they are not able to mannage it, and therefore you will not give it them, and when they come to ſo much underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as to know that they are not able to mannage it, they will not cry for it; ſo we would not cry for ſuch and ſuch things if we knew that we were not able to manage them: when you vex and fret for what you have not, I may ſay to you as Chriſt ſaith, you know not of what Spirit you are of. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> to <hi>Parillus,</hi> ſaith he (when they were ſpeaking about his extream poverty) <hi>Not ſo poor, though I have been very poor, yet I would be poorer, I could be willing to be poorer than I am,</hi> for the truth is (as if he ſhould ſay) the Lord knew that that was more ſutable to me, and I knew that my own heart was ſuch, that a poor condition was more ſutable to me than a rich; certainly would we ſay if we knew our own hearts, that ſuch and ſuch a condition is better for me than if it had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventh Leſſon, <hi>Is the burden of a proſperous eſtate.</hi> Such a one that comes into Chriſts School to be inſtructed in this Art, never comes to attain to any great skill in this Art till he comes to underſtand the burden that is in a proſperous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, What burden is there in a proſperous eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly a great burden, and there needs a great ſtrength to bear it: as men had need have ſtrong brains that can bear ſtrong Wine, ſo they had need of ſtrong ſpirits that are able to bear proſperous conditions, and not to do themſelves hurt; there's a fourfold burden in a proſperous eſtate. Many men and women look at the ſhine and glittering of proſperity, but they little think of the burden, but there's a fourfold bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There's <hi>Aburden of trouble.</hi> A Roſe hath its prickles; and ſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That he that will be rich, pierceth himſelf through with many ſorrows,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. If a mans heart be ſet upon it that he muſt be rich, and he will be rich; ſuch a man will pierce himſelf through with many ſorrows; he looks upon the delight and glory of riches that appears outwardly, but he conſiders not what piercing ſorrows he may meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:132683:49"/>in them: The conſideration of the trouble in a proſperous condition I have divers times thought of, and I cannot tell by what ſimilitude to expreſs it better, than by travelling in ſome Champion Country, where round about is very fair and ſandy ground, and you ſee there a Town a great way off in a bottom, and you think, O how bravely is that Town ſeated! but when you come and ride into the Town, you ſhall ride through a dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lane, and through acompany of fearful dirty holes, and you could not ſee the dirty lane and holes when you were two or three miles off: ſo ſometimes we look upon the proſperity of men and think ſuch a man lives bravely and comfortably, but if we did but know what troubles he meets withal in his family, in his eſtate, in his dealings with men, we would not think his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo happy, One may have a very fine new Shoo, but no body knows where it pinches him, but he that hath it on: ſo you think ſuch and ſuch men are happy, but they may have many troubles that you little think of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a burden of Danger in it.</hi> Men that are in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous condition they are in a great deal of danger: you ſee ſometimes in the evening when you light up your Candles, the Moths and the Gnats will be flying up and down in the Candle but they ſcorch their wings, and there they fall down dead; ſo there is a great deal of danger in a proſperous eſtate, thoſe men that are ſet upon a pinacle on high, theſe men they are in greater danger than other men are. Honey we know doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Bees and Waſps unto it; and ſo the ſweet of proſperity doth invite the Devil and Temptation. Men that are in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate, are ſubject to many temptations that other men are not ſubject to. The Scripture calls the Devil <hi>Beel-zebub,</hi> that is, the God of Flies; and ſo <hi>Beelzebub</hi> comes where the honey of proſperity is: They are in very great danger of temptations that are in a proſperous condition. The dangers of men that are in a proſperous eſtate, that have more than others, ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of by thoſe that are lower, think with thy ſelf, Though they be above me, yet they are in more danger than I am; the tall Trees are more ſhattered a great deal than low ſhrubs: ſo you know the ſhip that hath all the ſails up, the top ſail and all, in a ſtorm, this is in more danger than that that hath all the ſails
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:132683:49"/>drawn in: And ſo men that have their Top-gallant, and all up and brave, they are more like to be drown'd, drown'd in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than other men are; and therefore you know what the Scripture ſaith, how hard it is for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: ſuch a text ſhould make poor people to be contented with their eſtates. We have a notable example for that in the Children of <hi>Kohath,</hi> you ſhall find that they were in a more excellent eſtate than the other of the <hi>Levites,</hi> but they were in more danger than the other, and more trouble.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Children of <hi>Kohath</hi> were in a higher condition than other of the <hi>Levites,</hi> that I'll ſhew you out of the fourth of <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. verſ. there you ſhall find what their condition was. <hi>This ſhall be the ſervice of the ſons of</hi> Kohath <hi>in the Tabernacle of the Congregation about the moſt holy things.</hi> Mark, <hi>the Levites</hi> were exerciſed about <hi>holy things;</hi> but the ſons of <hi>Kohath,</hi> their ſervice was about the <hi>moſt holy things</hi> of all: and you ſhall find in the 21. of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> verſ. 10. That God did honor the ſons of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hath</hi> in a more ſpecial manner than he did honor the other <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> which honor the Children of <hi>Aaron</hi> (being of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> who were of the Children of <hi>Levi</hi>) had, for theirs was the firſt Lot, and they were prefer'd before the other families of <hi>Levi,</hi> thoſe that were imployed in the moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imployment, they had the moſt honorable Lot, the firſt Lot fel to them: Thus you ſee God honored the Children of the <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hathites.</hi> But (might other <hi>Levites</hi> ſay) how hath God preferred this family before us? They were honored more than the other were: But now, mark their burden that comes with heir Honor, and that I will ſhew you out of two Scriptures, firſt is, <hi>Num.</hi> 7.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>took the Wagons and Oxen, and gave them unto the</hi> Levites: <hi>Two Wagons and four Oxen he gave unto the ſons of</hi> Gerſhon, <hi>according to their ſervice: and four Wagons and eight Oxen he gave unto the ſons of</hi> Merari, <hi>according unto their ſervice, under the hand of</hi> Ithamer <hi>the ſon of</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſt.</hi> But ſaith he (verſ. 9.) <hi>Unto the ſons of</hi> Kohath <hi>he gave none; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſervice of the Sanctuary that belonged unto them, was, That they ſhould bear upon their ſhoulders.</hi> Mark, the other <hi>Levites</hi> had Oxen and Wagons given unto them, to eaſe them of their ſervice: but (ſaith he) to the ſons of <hi>Kohath</hi> he gave none,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:132683:50"/>but they ſhould bear their ſervice upon their ſhoulders; and that's the reaſon why God was ſo diſpleaſed, becauſe that they would have more eaſe in Gods ſervice than God would have them; for whereas they ſhould carry it upon their ſhoulders, they would carry it upon a Cart; Mark here, you ſee the firſt burden that they had, beyond what the other <hi>Levites</hi> had. And thoſe that are under them, think not of their burden that they are to carry upon their ſhoulders, when as others have means to eaſe them; and many times thoſe that are employed in the Miniſtery, or Magiſtracy, that ſit at the Stern to order the great Affairs of the Commonwealth and State, you think they live bravely: They lie awake when you are aſleep; if you knew the burden that lies upon their ſpirits, you would think that your labour and burden were very little in compariſon of theirs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's another burden of danger more than the reſt, and that you ſhall find in <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.17. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and unto</hi> Aaron <hi>ſaying, Cut ye not eff the tribe of the families of the</hi> Kohathites <hi>from among the</hi> Levites, <hi>but thus do unto them that they may live and not die: When they approach unto the moſt holy things,</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons ſhall go in and appoint them every one to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and to his burden; but they ſhall not go in to ſee when the holy things are covered, lest they die.</hi> Mark this text: ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Cut ye not off the tribe of the family of the <hi>Kohathites</hi> from among the <hi>Levites.</hi> Cut them not off, why? what had they done? had they done any thing amiſs? No, they had not done any thing that provoked God: but the meaning is this; Take a great care of the family of the <hi>Kohathites</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in their duty that they were to do; for (ſaith God) they are in a great deal of danger, being to ſerve in the moſt holy things: If they ſhould go in to ſee the holy things more than God would have them, it is as much as their lives are worth, and therefore if you ſhould but neglect them, and not inform them throughly in their duty, they would be undone: ſaith God, They are to adminiſter in the moſt holy things, and if they ſhould but dare to preſume to do any thing otherwiſe than God would have them about thoſe ſervices, it would coſt them their lives; and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:132683:50"/>therefore be not you careleſs of them, for if you neglect them you will be a means, of cutting them off. Thus you ſee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that the family of the <hi>Kohathites were in;</hi> they were preferr'd before others, but they were in more danger. So you think there are ſuch men in a Pariſh that bear the ſway, and are imployed in publike ſervice, and they carry all before them; but you conſider not their danger. And ſo the Miniſters, they ſtand in the fore-front of all the ſpight and malice of ungodly men: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God imploys them in honorable ſervice, and that ſervice that the Angels would take delight in; but though the ſervice be honorable, above the imployment of other works, yet the burden of danger that likewiſe is greater than the danger of men that are in an inferior condition. Now when the Soul comes to get wiſdom from Chriſt to think of the danger that it is in, then it will be content in that low eſtate in which it is. A poor man that is in a low condition, thinks, I am low, and others are raiſed, but I know not what their burden is: and ſo, if he be rightly inſtructed in the School of Chriſt he comes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In a proſperous eſtate there is the burden of Duty.</hi> You look onely at the ſweet and comfort that they have, and the honor and reſpect that they have that are in a proſperous condition; but you muſt conſider of the duty that they owe to God: God requires more duty at their hands than at yours; you are ready to be diſcontented that you have not ſuch parts and abilities as ſuch have, but God requires more duty of them that have more parts, God requires more duty of them that have greater eſtates than of you that have not ſuch eſtates, Oh! you would fain have the honour, but can you carry the burden of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt is, <hi>The burden of Account in a proſperous Eſtate.</hi> There is a great account that they are to give to God that enjoy great eſtates and a proſperous condition: Now we are all Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and one is a Steward to a meaner man, perhaps an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Knight; another is a Steward to a Nobleman, an Earl: now the Steward of the meaner man, he hath not ſo much as the other hath under his hand: now ſhall he be diſcontented becauſe there comes not ſo much under his hand as under the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:132683:51"/>others? No thinks he, I have leſs, and I am to give the leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: So your account in compariſon of the Miniſters and Magiſtrates will be nothing; you are to give an account of your own Souls, and ſo are they; but you are to give an account for your own family and ſo are they; but you are not to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for Congregations, and for Towns, and Cities, and Countries. You think of Princes and Kings, Oh! what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition they are in. But what do you think of a King to give account for all the diſorder, and wickedneſs in a Kingdom that he poſſibly might have prevented? What abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Glory might a Prince bring to God if ſo be that he bent his ſoul and all his thoughts to lift up the Name of God in a Kingdom; now what God looſes for want of this, that King, Prince, or Governor he muſt give an account for. It's a ſpeech of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in that place of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where it's ſaid that men muſt give an account for their Souls, he wonders that any men in publike place can be ſaved, becauſe their account is ſo great that they are to give. And I remember I have read a ſpeech of <hi>Philip</hi> that was King of <hi>Spain</hi> (though the ſtory ſaith of him, that he had ſuch a Natural conſcience, that he profeſt he would not do any thing againſt his conſcience, no not in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for the gaining of a world, yet when this man was to die) Oh ſaith he, that I had never been a King; Oh that I had liv'd a ſolitary and private life all my daies; then ſhould I have died a great deal more ſecurely, I ſhould with more confidence have gone before the Throne of God to give my account: but here's the fruit of my Kingdom, that I had all the glory of it, it hath made my account to be harder to give to God: and thus he cries out when he was to die. And therefore you that live in private conditions remember this, If you come into Chriſt's School, and be taught this Leſſon, you will be quiet in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, or private eſtate, in regard your account is not ſo great as others. Its a ſpeech I remember I have met withal in <hi>Latimers</hi> Sermons that he was wont to uſe, <hi>That the half is more than the whole.</hi> That is, when a man is in a mean condition, he is but half way towards the height of proſperity that others are in: yet ſaith he, this is more ſafe though it be a meaner condition than others. Thoſe that are in a high and proſperous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:132683:51"/>there is annexed to it the burden of trouble, and of danger, and of duty, and of account. And thus you ſee how Chriſt trains up his Scholars in his School, and though they be weak otherwiſe, yet by his Spirit he gives them wiſdom to underſtand theſe things a right.</p>
               <p>The eight leſſon is this, <hi>Chriſt teaches them what a great and dreadful evil it is to be given up to ones hearts deſires.</hi> The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding this Leſſon that it is a moſt dreadful evil, one of the moſt hideous and fearful evils that can befall any man upon the face of the Earth, for God to give him up to his hearts deſires: when the Soul underſtands this once, and together with it (for it goes along together) that ſpiritual Judgements are more fearful than any outward judgements in the world, the underſtanding of this, will teach any one to be content in Gods croſſing of them in their deſires. Thou art croſt in thy deſires, now thou art diſcontented and vext and fretted at it, Is that thy onely Miſery that thou art croſt in thy deſires? No, no, thou art infinitely miſtaken, the greateſt miſery of all is, for God to give thee up to thy hearts luſts and deſires, to give thee up to thine own counſels: ſo you have it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me</hi> [what then?] <hi>So I gave them up unto their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi> Oh ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> Let me not have ſuch a miſery as that is, for to give me what I would have, to give me my hearts deſires, it is one of the moſt hideous judgments in the world for a man to be given up to his hearts deſires. We have not indeed in Scripture any certain evident ſign of a Reprobate, we cannot ſay (except we knew a man had committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt) that he is a Reprobate, for we know not what God may work upon him; but the neereſt of all, &amp; the blackeſt ſign of a Reprobate is this, for God to give up a man to his hearts deſires, all the pain of Diſeaſes, all the calamities that can be thought of in the world, are no judgements in compariſon of this, for a man to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to his hearts deſires; now when the Soul comes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, the Soul then cries out, Why am I ſo troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that I have not my deſires? There is nothing that God conveys his wrath more through than a proſperous Eſtate.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:132683:52"/>I remember I have read of a Jewiſh Tradition that they ſay of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> when God ſtruck <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> with a Leproſie, they ſay that the beams of the Sun was darted upon the forehead of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,</hi> and he was ſtruck with a Leproſie with the darting of the beams of the Sun upon his forehead; the Scripture ſaith, Indeed the Prieſts looked upon him; but they ſay there was a ſpecial light and beam of the Sun upon the forehead that did diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Leproſie to the Prieſts, and they ſay it was the way of conveying of it. Whether that were true or no, I am ſure this is true, that the ſtrong beams of the Sun of proſperity upon many men makes them to be leprous; Would any poor man in the Country have been diſcontented that he was not in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziahs</hi> condition? He was a great King, I but there was the Leproſie in his fore-head; the poor man may ſay, though I live meanly in the Country, yet I thank God my body is whole and ſound, would not any man rather have ruſſet and skins of beaſts to cloath him with, than to have ſattin and velvet that ſhould have the Plague in it? The Lord conveyes the Plague of his curſe through proſperity, as much as through any thing in the world, and therefore the ſoul coming to underſtand this, this makes it to be quiet and content.</p>
               <p>And then, <hi>Spiritual Judgements are the greateſt Judgements of all;</hi> the Lord ſays ſuch an Affliction upon my outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but what if he had taken away my life? A mans health is a greater mercy than his eſtate; and you that are poor people you ſhould conſider of that, But is the health of a mans body better than his eſtate? what is the health of a mans ſoul? that's a great deal better; the Lord hath inflicted external judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but he hath not inflicted ſpiritual Judgements upon thee, he hath not given thee up to hardneſs of heart, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the ſpirit of prayer from thee in thine afflicted eſtate, Oh then be of good comfort though there be outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon thee, yet thy ſoul, thy more excellent part is not affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Now when the ſoul comes to underſtand this, that here lies the ſore wrath of God, to be given up to a mans deſires, and for Spiritual Judgements to be upon a man, this quiets him, and contents him, though outward afflictions be upon him; perhaps one of a mans children hath the fit of an ague, or the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:132683:52"/>tooth-ach, but perhaps his next neighbor hath the plague, or all his children are dead of the plague, now ſhall he be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, becauſe his children have the tooth-ach when his neighbors children are dead? Now think thus, Lord thou haſt laid an afflicted condition upon me, but Lord thou haſt not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me the plague of a hard heart. Now take theſe eight things before mentioned, and lay them together, and you may well apply that Scripture in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. the laſt verſe, ſaith the text there <hi>They alſo that erred in Spirit, ſhall come to underſtanding, and they that murmured ſhall learn Doctrine.</hi> Hath there been any of you (as I fear many may be found) that have erred in ſpirit, even in regard of this truth that now we are preaching of, and many that have murmured, Oh that this day you might come to underſtand, that Chriſt would bring you into his School, and teach you underſtanding, <hi>And they that murmured ſhall learn Doctrine:</hi> what Doctrine ſhall they learn? Theſe eight Doctrines that I have opened to you. And if you will but throughly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy theſe leſſons that I have ſet before your eyes: It will be a ſpecial help and means to cure your murmuring againſt, and repinings at the hand of God: And ſo you will come to learn Chriſtian Contentment.

               <p>The Ninth and laſt Leſſon that Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thoſe that he doth inſtruct in this Art of Contentment, <hi>It is the right knowledge of Gods Providence,</hi> and therein are theſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Univerſality of Providence,</hi> that the ſoul muſt be throughly inſtructed in to come to this Art, to underſtand the Univerſality of Providence, that is; how the Providence of God goes through the whole world, extends it ſelf to every thing: Not onely that God by his providence doth rule the world, and govern all things in general, but that it reaches to every particular, not onely to Kingdoms, to order the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Kingdoms, but it reaches to every mans Family, it reaches to every perſon in the Family, it reaches to every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yea, to every paſſage, to every thing that falls out concerning thee in every particular, not one hair falls from thy head, not a Sparrow to the ground without the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. There's nothing befalls thee, good or evil, but there is a providence of the Infinite Eternal Firſt-being in that thing, and therein indeed is Gods Infiniteneſs, that it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the leaſt things, to the leaſt worm that is under thy feet: Then much more it reaches unto thee that art a rational Creature, the Providence of God is more ſpecial towards ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures than any others: The underſtanding in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:132683:53"/>way the univerſality of providence in every particular paſſage from morning to night every day; that there's not any thing that doth befall thee, but there's a hand of God in it, it is from God, it is a mighty furtherance to Contentment. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man will grant the truth of the thing that it is ſo, but as the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>By faith we underſtand that the worlds were made,</hi> by faith we underſtand it; why by faith? we can underſtand by reaſon that no finite thing can be from it ſelf, And therefore that the world could not be of it ſelf, but we can underſtand it by ſaith in another manner than by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So whatſoever we underſtand of God in way of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet when Chriſt doth take us into his School we come to underſtand it by faith in a better manner than we do by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The efficacy that there is in providence;</hi> that is, That the providence of God goes on in all things with ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and it is not to be altered by our power; let us be diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and vext and troubled, and fret, and rage, yet we muſt not think to alter the courſe of providence by our diſcontent. Some of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends ſaid to him, <hi>Shall the earth be forſaken for thee, and ſhall the rock be removed out of his place?</hi> Job 18.4. when they ſaw him to be impatient. So I may ſay to every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented impatient heart, What, ſhall the providence of God change its courſe for thee? Do'ſt thou think it ſuch a weak thing, that becauſe it doth not pleaſe thee, it muſt alter its courſe? Be thou content or not content, the providence of God will go on, it hath an efficacy of power and vertue, to carry all things before it. Canſt thou make one hair black or white with all the ſtir that thou keepeſt? When you are in a Ship at Sea that hath all her Sails ſpread with a full gale of wind, and ſwiftly ſailing; Can you make it ſtand ſtill with running up and down in the Ship? No more can you make the providence of God to alter and change its courſe with your vexing and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but it will go on with power do what thou canſt. Do but underſtand the power and efficacy of providence and it will be a mighty means for the helping to learn this leſſon of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The infinite variety of the works of providence,</hi> and yet <hi>the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:132683:54"/>order of things one working towards another;</hi> there is infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the works of God in an ordinary providence, and yet all work in an orderly way; we put theſe two together, for God in the way of his providence cauſes a thouſand thouſand things one to depend upon another, there are infinite ſeveral Wheels (as I may ſay) in the works of providence, all the works that ever God did from all eternity or ever will do, put them all together, and all make up but one work, and they have been as ſeveral wheels that have had their orderly motion to attain the end that God from all eternity hath appointed. We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed look at things by pieces, we look at one particular and do not conſider the reference that one thing hath to another; but God he looks at all things at once, and ſees the reference that one thing hath to another: As a Childe that looks upon a Clock, looks firſt upon one wheel, and then upon another wheel, he looks not at all together, or the dependance that one hath upon another, but the workman hath his eyes upon all together and ſees the dependance of all one upon another, and the Art that there is in the dependance of one upon another; ſo it is in Gods providence. Now obſerve how this works to Contentment; where there is ſuch a paſſage of providence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls me, that's one wheel, and it may be if this wheel ſhould be ſtopt, there might a thouſand other wheels come to be ſtopt by this: as in a Clock, ſtop but one wheel and you ſtop every wheel, becauſe they have dependance one upon another: ſo when God hath ordered a thing for the preſent to be thus and thus, how do'ſt thou know how many things do depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this thing? God may have ſome work that he hath to do twenty yeers hence that may depend upon this paſſage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that falls out this day, or this week. And here (by the way) we may ſee a great deal of evil that there is in diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for thou wouldeſt have Gods providence altered in ſuch and ſuch a particular, indeed if it were onely in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that had reference to nothing elſe it were not ſo much, but by thy deſire to have thy will in ſuch a particular, it may be thou wouldeſt croſs God in a thouſand things that he hath to bring about, becauſe it's poſſible there may be a thouſand things depend upon that one thing that thou wouldeſt fain
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:132683:54"/>have to be otherwiſe than it is; juſt as if a childe ſhould cry out and ſay, Let but that one wheel ſtop; though he ſaith but one wheel, yet if that ſtop, it is as much as if he ſhould ſay, they muſt all ſtop: So in providence, let but this one paſſage of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſtop, it is as much as if a thouſand ſtopt: Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be quiet and content, for though I be croſt in ſome one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, God attains his end, at leaſt his end may be furthered in a thouſand things by this one thing that I am croſt in; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let a man conſider, this is an act of providence, and how do I know what God is about to do, and how many things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this providence? Now we are willing to ſuffer our friends will to be croſt in one thing, ſo that our friend may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to what he deſires in a thouſand things: If thou haſt a love and friendſhip to God, be willing to be croſt in ſome few things, that the Lord may have his Work go on in the univerſal, in a thouſand of other things. Now that's the third thing to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in Gods providence, that Chriſt doth learn thoſe that he teacheth in the Art of Contentment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt teacheth them the knowledge of Providence, that is, <hi>The knowledge of Gods uſual way in his dealing with his People more particularly.</hi> The other is, the knowledge of God in his Providence in general: But the right underſtanding of the way of God in his providence towards his People and Saints, is a notable Leſſon to help us in the Art of Contentment. If we come once to know a mans way and courſe, we may better ſute and be contented to live with him than before we came to know his way and courſe: As when a man comes to live in a ſociety with men and women, it may be the men and women may be good, but till a man comes to know their way and courſe and diſpoſition, many things may fall very croſs, and we think they are very hard, but when we come to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their way and ſpirit, then we can ſute and concur with them very well? and the reaſon of our trouble is, becauſe we do not underſtand their way. So it is with you, thoſe that are but as ſtrangers to God, and do not underſtand the way of God, they are troubled with the providences of God, and they think them very ſtrange, and cannot tell what to make of them; becauſe they underſtand not the ordinary courſe and way of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:132683:55"/>God towards his People. If a ſtranger ſometimes comes into a family, and ſees ſuch and ſuch things done, he wonders what the matter is, but thoſe that are acquainted with it, it troubles them not at all. So ſervants, when they come firſt together and know not one another, it may be they are froward and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, but when they come to be acquainted with one anothers ways, then they are more contented: Juſt ſo it is when we come firſt to underſtand Gods ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>What do you underſtand by Gods ways?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By that I mean theſe three things. And when we come to know them, we ſhall not wonder ſo much at the providence of God, but be quiet and contented with them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt thing is this: <hi>Gods ordinary courſe is, That his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this world ſhould be in an afflicted condition:</hi> God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Word, and we may there find he hath ſet it down to be his ordinary way, even from the beginning of the world to this day (but more eſpecially in the times of the Goſpel) that his People here ſhould be in an afflicted condition. Now men that do not underſtand this, they ſtand and wonder to hear of the People of God that they are afflicted, and the enemies proſper in their way; for thoſe that ſeek God in his way, and ſeek for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, for them to be afflicted, routed and ſpoiled, and the enemies to prevail, they wonder at it: But now, one that is in the School of Chriſt, he is taught by Jeſus Chriſt, that God by his eternal Counſels hath ſet this to be his courſe and way, to bring up his People in this world in an afflicted condition, and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Account it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. We are not therefore to be diſcontented with it, ſeeing God hath ſet ſuch a courſe and way, and we know ſuch is the will of God that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that is in Gods way is this, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſually when God intends the greateſt mercy to any of his People, he doth bring them into the loweſt condition.</hi> God doth ſeem to go quite croſs and work in a contrary way; when he intends the greateſt mercies to his People, he doth firſt uſually bring them into very low conditions, if it be a bodily mercy, an outward mercy that he intends to beſtow, he uſeth to bring them bodily low, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:132683:55"/>low, if it be a mercy in their eſtates that he intends to beſtow, he brings them low in that, and then raiſes them; and in their names he brings them low there, and then raiſes them; and in their ſpirits, God doth ordinarily bring their ſpirits low, and then raiſes their ſpirits; uſually the People of God before the greateſt comfort, have the greateſt afflictions and ſorrows, now thoſe that underſtand not Gods ways, they think that when God brings his People into ſad conditions, that God leaves and forſakes them, and that God doth intend no great matter of good to them; but now a Childe of God that is inſtructed in this way of God, he is not troubled; my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very low, but (ſaith he) this is Gods way when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the greateſt mercy, to bring men under the greateſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. When he intended to raiſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be the Second in the Kingdom, God caſt him into a dungeon a little before. So when God intended to raiſe <hi>David</hi> and ſet him upon the Throne, he made him to be hunted as a Partridge in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.20. God went this way with his Son; Chriſt himſelf went into Glory by ſuffering, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.20. And if God deal ſo with his own Son, much more with his People; As a little before break of day you ſhall obſerve it is darker than it was any time before; ſo God doth uſe to make our conditions darker a little before the mercy come. When God beſtowed the laſt great mercy at <hi>Nazby,</hi> we were in a very low condition, God knew what he had to do before-hand, he knew that his time was coming for great mercies; it is the way of God to do ſo. Be but inſtructed aright in this courſe and tract that God uſes to walk in; and that will help us to Contentment exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>The Third thing that there is in Gods way and courſe is this, <hi>It is the way of God to work by contraries, to turn the greatest evil into the greateſt good.</hi> To grant great good after great evil is one thing, and to turn great evils into the greateſt good that's another; and yet that's Gods way, the greateſt good that God intends for his People, many times he works it out of the greateſt evil, the greateſt light is brought out of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt darkneſs: and <hi>Luther</hi> (I remember) hath a notable expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this (ſaith he) it is the way of God, he doth humble
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:132683:56"/>that he might exalt, he doth kill that he might make alive, he doth confound that he might glorifie; this is the way of God (ſaith he) but (ſaith he) every one doth not underſtand this, this is the Art of Arts, and the Science of Sciences, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of knowledges to underſtand this, that God doth uſe when he will bring life, he doth uſe to bring it out of death, he brings joy out of ſorrow, and he brings proſperity out of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, yea, and many times he brings Grace out of Sin, that is, makes uſe of ſin to work furtherance of Grace; it is the way of God to bring good out of evil; not only to overcome the evil, but to make the evil to work towards good: here's the way of God: now when the ſoul comes to underſtand this, it will take away our murmuring, and bring Contentment into our ſpirits: But I fear there are but few that underſtand it aright, perhaps they read of ſuch things, and hear of ſuch things in a Sermon, but they are not by Jeſus Chriſt inſtructed in this, that this is the way of God, To bring the greateſt good out of the greateſt evil.</p>
               <p>Thus having diſpatcht the Third Head, the Leſſons that we are to learn; we come to the Fourth, and that is, <hi>The excellency of this Grace of Contentment:</hi> And there is a great deal of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in Contentment; that's a kind of Leſſon too for us to learn. And this Head likewiſe will be ſomewhat long.</p>
               <p>Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>I have learned.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God for this: Oh! it is a mercy of God to me that I have learned this Leſſon, I find ſo much good in this Contentment, that I would not for a world but have it: (I have learned it ſaith he.)</p>
               <p>Now the very Heathens had a ſight of a great Excellency that there is in Contentment. I remember I have read of <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> a Philoſopher, that deſired of his Gods (ſpeaking after the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh way) nothing in this world to make his life happy, but CONTENTMENT; and if he might have any thing that he would deſire to make his life happy, he would ask of them, That he might have the ſpirit of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he might have ſuch a ſpirit as <hi>Socrates</hi> had, to be able to bear any wrong, any
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:132683:56"/>injuries that he met withal, and to continue in a quiet temper of ſpirit whatſoever befell him; for what was the temper of <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> whatever befell him he continued the ſame man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever croſs befell him no body could perceive any alteration of his ſpirit, though never ſo great croſſes did befall him. This a Heathen did attain to by the ſtrength of Nature, and a common work of the ſpirit: Now this <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> ſaw ſuch an excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in this ſpirit: As when God ſaid to <hi>Solomon,</hi> What ſhall I give thee? he asked of God wiſdom: ſo ſaith he, If the Gods ſhould put it to me to know what I would have, I ſhould deſire this thing, that I might have the ſpirit of <hi>Socrates:</hi> he ſaw a great excellency that there was in this. And certainly a Chriſtian may ſee abundance of excellency in it: I ſhall labor to ſet it out to you in this Sermon that you may be in love with this Grace of Contentment.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, <hi>By Contentment we come to give God that Worſhip that is due to him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See this opened at large in <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Worſhip</hi> on Levit. <hi>10.3.</hi>
                  </note> It is a ſpecial part of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that we owe to God, If we be content in a Chriſtian way according as hath been opened to you; I ſay it is a ſpecial part of the Divine Worſhip that the Creature ows to the infinite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in that I do render that reſpect that is due from me to the Creator. The words that the Greeks have that ſignifies to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it is as much as to come and crouch before another, as a Dog ſhould come crouching unto you, and be willing to lie down at your feet; ſo the Creature in the apprehenſion of its own baſeneſs, and the infinite Excellency that there is in God above it; when it comes to worſhip God, it comes and crouches to this God, and it lies down at the feet of God, then doth the Creature worſhip God. When you ſee a dog come crouching to you, and you can make him with holding your hand over him to lie down at your feet; then conſider, thus ſhould you do before the Lord, you ſhould come crouching to him, and lie down at his feet even upon your backs or bellies, to lie down in the duſt before him, ſo as to be willing that he ſhould do with you what he will; as ſometimes you may turn a dog this way and that way, up and down with the hand, and there he lies before you, according to your ſhewing him with your hand: So when the Creature ſhall come and lie down thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:132683:57"/>the Lord, then a Creature worſhips God, doth render up that worſhip that is due to God. Now in what diſpoſition of heart do we thus crouch to God more, then when we have this Contentation in all conditions that God diſpoſeth us unto? This is a crouching unto Gods diſpoſe, to be like the poor woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when Chriſt ſaid, it is not fit to give Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens meat to dogs, but (ſaith ſhe) the dogs have crums. I am a dog I confeſs, I but let me have but a crum. And ſo when the ſoul ſhall be in ſuch a diſpoſition as to lie down and ſay, Lord, I am but as a dog, yet let me have a crum, then doth it highly honor God. It may be ſome of you have not your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpread as others have, but God gives you crums; now ſaith the poor woman, dogs have crums, and when you can find your hearts thus ſubjecting unto God, to be but as a dog, and can be contented and bleſs God for any crum, I ſay, this is a great worſhip of God, you worſhip God by this more than when you come to hear a Sermon, or ſpend half an hour, or an hour in prayer, or when you come to receive a Sacrament; Theſe are the Acts of Gods Worſhip, I but theſe are but external Acts of Worſhip, to Hear, and Pray, and receive Sacraments: But now this is the Soul-worſhip, to ſubject it ſelf thus to God. You that often will worſhip God by Hearing, and Praying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sacraments, and yet afterwards will be froward and diſcontented, know, that God regards not that worſhip, he will have the Soul-worſhip in this ſubjecting of the ſoul to God. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it I beſeech you; in active Obedience, there we worſhip God by doing that that pleaſes God, but by paſſive Obedience we do as well worſhip God by being pleaſed with that which God doth. Now when I perform a duty, I worſhip God, I do what pleaſes God: why ſhould I not as well worſhip God when I am pleaſed with what God doth? As it was ſaid of Chriſts obedience, Chriſt was active in his paſſive Obedience, and paſſive in his active obedience: So the Saints they are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in their active obedience; they are firſt paſſive in their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace, and then active: And when they come to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience they are active, they put forth Grace in active obedience, when they perform actions to God, then ſaith the Soul, Oh! that I could do that that pleaſes God, when they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:132683:57"/>come to ſuffer any croſs, On that what God doth might pleaſe me. I labour to do what pleaſes God, and I labour that what God doth ſhall pleaſe me, here's a Chriſtian indeed that ſhall endeavor both theſe: now this is but one ſide of a Chriſtian, to endeavor to do what pleaſes God, but you muſt as well endeavor to be pleaſed with what God doth, and ſo you ſhall come to be a compleat Chriſtian when you can do both. And that's the firſt thing in the excellency of this Grace of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing in opening of this Excellency of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, <hi>That in Contentment there is much exerciſe of Grace,</hi> There is much ſtrength of Grace, yea there is much beauty of Grace in Contentment, there is much exerciſe of Grace, ſtrength of Grace, and beauty of Grace, I put all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Much exerciſe of Grace,</hi> There is a compoſition of Grace in Contentment, there is faith, and there is humility, and love, and there is patience, and there is wiſdom, and there is hope, all Graces almoſt are compounded, it's an oyl that hath the ingredients of all kind of graces, and therefore though you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the particular Grace, yet in this oyl you have it all; God ſees the Graces of his Spirit exerciſed in a ſpecial manner, and this pleaſes God at the heart to ſee the Graces of his Spirit exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. In ſome one action that you do you may exerciſe ſome one grace eſpecially, but now in Contentment you exerciſe a great many Graces at once.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a great deal of ſtrength of Grace in Contentment.</hi> It argues a great deal of ſtrength in the body, the body to be able to endure hard weather and whatſoever falls out, and yet not to be much altered by it; ſo it argues ſtrength of Grace to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; You that complain of weakneſs of memory, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of parts, you cannot do what others do in other things, but have you this gracious Heart-contentment, that hath been opened to you? I know that you have attained to ſtrength of Grace in this, when it is ſo ſpiritual as hath been opened to you in the explication of this point. As it is with a mans brain, if a man be diſtempered in his body and hath many obſtructions in his body, hath an ill ſtomach, and his ſpleen
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:132683:58"/>and liver obſtructed, and yet for all this his brain is not diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, it is an argument of a great ſtrength of brain, and though there be many ill fumes that riſe from his corrupt ſtomach, yet ſtill his brain is not diſtempered, but he continues in the free exerciſe of the uſe of his reaſon and underſtanding; every one may underſtand that this man hath a very ſtrong brain, that ſuch things ſhall not diſtemper him, whereas other people that have a weak brain, if they do not digeſt but one meals meat, the ſumes that do ariſe from their ſtomachs, do diſtemper their brain, and make them unfit for every thing, whereas you ſhall have others that have ſtrong heads, and ſtrong brains, though their ſtomachs be ill that they do not digeſt meat, yet ſtill they have the free uſe of their brain, this argues ſtrength: So it is in a mans ſpirit, you ſhall have many that have weak ſpirits, and if they have any ill fumes, if accidents befall them, you ſhall preſently have them out of temper, but you ſhall have other men that though things do fume up, yet ſtill they keep in a ſteady way, and have the uſe of reaſon and of other graces, and poſſeſs their ſouls with patience. As I remember it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Eagle, it's not like other Fowls, other Fowls when they are hungry make a noiſe, but the Eagle is never heard to make a noiſe, though it wants food, and it's from the magnitude of his ſpirit, that will not make ſuch complaints as other Fowls will do when they want food, it is becauſe it is above hunger, and above thirſt: So it is an argument of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious magnitude of ſpirit, that whatſoever befalls it, yet it is not always whining and complaining ſo as others are, but goes on ſtill in its way and courſe, and bleſſes God and keeps in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tenour whatſoever thing befalls it: ſuch things as cauſes others to be dejected, and fretted and vexed, and takes away all the comfort of their lives, it makes no alteration at all in the ſpirits of theſe men and women, I ſay this is a ſign of a great deal of ſtrength of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It's alſo an argument of a great deal of beauty of Grace.</hi> It's a ſpeech that <hi>Seneca</hi> a Heathen once had, ſaith he, When you go abroad into groves and woods: and there you ſee the tallneſs of the trees and their ſhadows, it ſtrikes a kind of awful fear of a Deity in you, and when you ſee the vaſt rivers and fountains,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:132683:58"/>and deep waters that ſtrikes a kind of fear of a God in you, but (ſaith he) do you ſee a man that is quiet in tempeſts, and that lives happily in the midſt of adverſities, why do not you Worſhip that man? He doth think him a man even to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſhall be quiet and live a happy life though in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of adverſities. The Glory of God appears here more than in any of his Works? there is no Works that God hath made, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and all the World, wherein ſo much of the Glory of God doth appear, as in a man that lives quietly in the midſt of adverſity. That was that that convinced the King, when he ſaw the three children could walk in the midſt of the fiery furnace &amp; not to be touched, the King was mightily convinced by this, that ſurely their God was a great God indeed, and that they were highly beloved of their God that could walk in the midſt of the furnace and not be touch't, whereas the others that came but to the mouth of the furnace were devoured; ſo when a Chriſtian can walk in the midſt of fiery trials, and not his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſinged, but have comfort and joy in the midſt of all (as <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſtocks) can ſing (that wrought upon the Jaylor:) ſo it will convince men when they ſee the power of Grace in the middeſt of afflictions, ſuch afflictions as would make others to roar under them, yet they can behave themſelves in a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy manner; Oh! it's the glory of a Chriſtian. It is that that is ſaid to be the glory of Chriſt (for ſo by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it is thought to be meant of Chriſt) In <hi>Micah</hi> 5.5. <hi>And this man</hi> (the text ſaith) <hi>ſhall be the peace, when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our Land, and when he ſhall tread in our Pallaces.</hi> This man ſhall be the peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our land; for one to be in peace, when there is no Enemies, it's no great matter, but ſaith the text when the Aſſyrian ſhall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Land, then this man ſhall be the peace; that is, when all ſhall be in an hubbub &amp; uproar, yet then this man ſhall be peace. That's the tryal of Grace when you find Jeſus Chriſt in your hearts to be peace, when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into the Land. You may think you find peace in Chriſt when you have no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles, but is Chriſt your peace when the Aſſyrian comes into the Land, when the Enemy comes? Suppoſe you ſhould hear the enemy come marching to the City, &amp; had taken
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:132683:59"/>the Works, and were plundering, what would be your peace? Jeſus Chriſt would be peace to the ſoul, when the enemy comes into the City, and into your houſes: If there be any of you that have been where the enemy hath come, What hath been the peace of your ſouls? That which is ſaid of Chriſt may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this grace of Contentment, when the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> the Plunderers, the Enemies, when any affliction, trouble, diſtreſs doth befall ſuch a heart, then this Grace of Contentment brings peace to the ſoul; at that time brings peace to the ſoul, when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> comes into the Land. The Grace of Contentment it's an excellent Grace, there's much beauty, much ſtrength in it; there is a great deal of worth in this Grace, and therefore be in love with it.</p>
               <p>The third thing in the Excellency of Contentment, is this: <hi>By Contentment the ſoul is fitted to receive mercy, and to do ſervice.</hi> I'le put theſe two together, Contentment makes the ſoul fit to receive mercy, and to do ſervice; no man or woman in the world is ſo fit for to receive the Grace of God, and to do the Work of God, as thoſe that have contented ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe are fitted to receive mercy from the Lord that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented:</hi> as now; If you would have a veſſel to take in any liquor, you muſt hold the veſſel ſtill, if the veſſel ſtir and ſhake up and down you cannot powre in any thing, but you will bid, hold ſtill that you may powre it in, and not loſe any: So, if we would be the veſſels to receive Gods mercy, and would have the Lord powre in his mercy to us, we muſt have quiet, ſtil hearts, we muſt not have hearts hurrying up &amp; down in trouble, diſcontent, and vexing, but we muſt have ſtill and quiet hearts if we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy from the Lord: If a Childe flings and throws up and down for a thing, you will not give it him then when he cries ſo, but firſt you will have the Childe quiet; though perhaps you do intend the Childe ſhall have the thing he cries for, but you will not give it him till he is quiet, and comes and ſtands ſtill before you, and is contented without it, and then you will give it him: And truly ſo doth the Lord deal with us (for our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with him are juſt as your froward Children are with you) as ſoon as you would have a thing from God, if you have it not you are diſquieted preſently and all in an uproar (as it were)
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:132683:59"/>in your ſpirits: God intends mercy to you, but ſaith God, you ſhall not have it yet, I will ſee you quiet firſt, and then in the quietneſs of your hearts, come to me and ſee what I will do with you. I appeal to you, you that are any ways acquainted with the ways of God, Have you not found this to be the way of God towards you, when you have been troubled for want perhaps of ſome Spiritual comfort, and your hearts were vext at it, you get nothing from God all this while; but now, if you have got your heart into a quiet frame, and can ſay, Well, it's fit the Lord ſhould do with us poor Creatures what he will, I am under his feet, and am reſolv'd to do what I can to honor him; and let him do with me what he will, I will ſeek him as long as I live, I will be content with what God gives, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gives or no I will be content; yea, are you in this frame ſaith God? now you ſhall have comfort, now I will give you the mercy. A priſoner muſt not think to get off his fetters by pulling and tearing, he may gall his fleſh and rend it to the very bone, certainly he will be unfettered never the ſooner, but if he would have his fetters taken off, he muſt quietly give up himſelf to ſome man to take them off. If a beggar after he hath knockt once or twice at the door and you come not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he is vext and troubled and thinks much that you let him ſtand a little while without any thing, you think that this beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is not fit to receive an alms; but if you hear two or three Beggars at your door, and if you hear them out at your win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ſay, Let us be content to ſtay, perhaps they are buſie, it is fit that we ſhould ſtay, it's well if we have any thing at laſt, we deſerve nothing at all, and therefore we may well wait a while; you would then quickly ſend them an alms: So God deals with the heart, when it is in a diſquiet way, then God doth not give; but when the heart lies down quietly under Gods hand, then is the heart in a fit frame to receive mercy: <hi>Your ſtrength ſhall be, to ſit ſtill</hi> ſaith God; you ſhall not be delivered from <hi>Babylon</hi> but by your ſitting ſtill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As fit to receive mercy, <hi>ſo fit to do ſervice;</hi> Oh! the quiet fruits of Righteouſneſs, the peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs; they indeed do proſper and multiply moſt when they come to be peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs. As the Philoſophers ſay
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:132683:60"/>of every thing that moves, nothing that moves but it moves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomething that is immoveable; as a thing that moves upon the earth, if the earth were not ſtill it could not move.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Ships move upon the Sea, and that is not ſtill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the Seas they move upon that which is ſtill and immoveable, there is nothing moves but it hath ſomething im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable that doth uphold it: the wheels in a Coach they move up and down, but the Axle-tree that moves not up and down; ſo it is with the heart of man. As they ſay of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it moves up and down upon a Pole that is immoveable; ſo it is in the heart of man, if he will move to do ſervice to God he muſt have a ſteady heart with him, that muſt help him to move in the ſervice of God, thoſe that have unſteady diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſpirits that have no ſtedfaſtneſs at all in them, they are not fit to do ſervice for God, but ſuch as have ſtedfaſtneſs in their ſpirits they are men and women fit to do any ſervice, and that's the reaſon that when the Lord hath any great work for any ſervants of his to do, uſually he doth firſt quiet their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, he doth bring their ſpirits into a quiet ſweet frame to be contented with any thing, and then he ſets them about imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The fifth excellency is this, <hi>Contentment it doth deliver us from abundance of temptations.</hi> Oh the temptations that men of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſpirits are ſubject to. The Devil loves to fiſh in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters. That's our proverb of men and women, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition is to fiſh in troubled waters, they ſay it is good fiſhing in troubled waters, this is the maxim of the Devil, he loves to fiſh in troubled waters, where he ſees the ſpirits of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men troubled and vext, there the Devil comes (ſaith he) there's good fiſhing for me, when he ſees men and women go diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented up and down and he can get them alone, then he comes with his temptations (ſaith he) Will you ſuffer ſuch a thing? take ſuch a ſhifting indirect way, do not you ſee how poor you are, others are brave, you know not what you ſhall do againſt winter, to provide fewel and get bread for you and your children, and ſo he tempts them to unlawful courſes: this is the ſpecial diſtemper that the Devil faſtens upon, when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:132683:60"/>he brings men and women to give up their ſouls to him, it is upon diſcontent: That the ground of all thoſe that have been witches, and ſo have given up themſelves to the Devil, the riſe of it hath been their diſcontent, and therefore it is obſervable that thoſe the Devil worketh upon to make them Witches, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they are old and melancholly people, and women eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and thoſe that are of the poorer ſort that are diſcontent at home, their Neighbours trouble them and vex them, and their ſpirits are weak and they cannot bear it, ſo upon that the Devil faſtens his temptations and draws them to any thing, if they be poor, then he promiſeth them money, if they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful ſpirits, then he tells them that he will revenge them upon ſuch and ſuch perſons, now this quiets and contents them. Oh! there's matter of temptation for the Devil where he meets with a diſcontented ſpirit. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith of God, God doth not dwell in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but in <hi>Salem, Babylon</hi> ſignifies confuſion, and <hi>Salem</hi> ſignifies peace, now God doth not dwell in ſpirits that are in a confuſion, but he dwells in peaceable and quiet ſpirits, O if you would free your ſelves from temptations la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Contentment: It is the peace of God that guards the heart from temptation. I remember I have read of one <hi>Marius Curio</hi> that when he had bribes ſent him to tempt him to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to his Country, he was ſitting at home at dinner with a diſh of turnips; and they came and promiſed him rewards, ſaith he; that man that can be content with this fare that I have, will not be tempted with your rewards, I thank God I am content with this fare, and as for rewards let them be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe that cannot be content to dine with a diſh of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips: So the truth is we ſee it apparently, that the reaſon why many do betray their truſt, as in the Parliament ſervice and Kingdom, is, becauſe they cannot be contented to be in a low condition. Let a man be contented to be in a low condition, and to go meanly cloathed if God ſees it fit, ſuch a man is ſhot-free (as I may ſo ſay) from thouſands of temptations of the Devil, that do prevail againſt others to the damning of their ſouls: Oh in ſuch times as thoſe are when men are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the loſs of their eſtates I ſay thoſe men that have not got this grace, are in a moſt lamentable condition, they are in more
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:132683:61"/>danger for their ſouls than they are for their outward eſtates, you think it is a ſad thing to be in danger of your outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates that you may loſe all in a night, but if you have not this contented ſpirit within you, you are in more danger of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Devil, to be plundered that way of any good, and to be led into ſin; Oh when men think thus, they muſt live as brave as they were wont to do, theſe men make themſelves a prey to the Devil; but ſuch as can ſay, let God do with me what he pleaſes, I am content to ſubmit to his hand in it, the Devil will ſcarce meddle with ſuch men. It's a notable ſpeech of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher that lived upon mean fare, and as he was eating herbs and roots, ſaith one to him, If you would but pleaſe <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> you need not eat herbs and roots: but he anſwered him thus, If you would but be content with ſuch mean fare, you need not flatter <hi>Dyoniſius.</hi> So temptations will no more prevail upon a contented man, than a dart that is thrown againſt a braſen wall. That's the fifth particular.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Excellency is, <hi>The abundant comforts in a mans life that Contentment will bring:</hi> Contentment will make mans life exceeding ſweet and comfortable, nothing more than the Grace of Contentment; many ways I will ſhew how it brings in Comfort.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As firſt, What a man hath, <hi>he hath it in a kind of Independent way,</hi> not depending upon any creature for his comfort.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>A contented man whoſe eſtate is low, if God raiſes his eſtate he hath the love of God in it,</hi> and then it's abundantly more ſweet than if he had it and his heart not contented; or if he had not the love of God in it: for it may be God grants to a diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man his deſire, but he cannot ſay it is from love; if a man hath quieted his ſpirit firſt, and then God grant him his deſire, he may have more comfort in it, and more aſſurance that he hath the love of God in it.</item>
                  <item>3. This Contentment is a comfort to a mans ſpirit in this, <hi>That it doth keep in his comforts, and keep out whatſoever may damp his comforts, or put out the light of them.</hi> I may compare this Grace of Contentment to a Mariners Lanthorn, a Mariner when he is at ſea, let him have never ſo much proviſion in his Ship, yet if he be thouſands of leagues from land, or in a rode that he ſhall not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:132683:61"/>meet with a Ship in three or four months, if he hath never a Lanthorn in his Ship, nor nothing whereby he may keep a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light in a ſtorm, he will be in a ſad condition, he would give a great deal to have a Lanthorn, or ſomething that may ſerve inſtead of it. When a ſtorm comes in the night, and he cannot have any light come above board, but it is puft out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, his condition is very ſad: ſo many men can have light of comfort when there is no ſtorm, but let there come but any affliction, any ſtorm upon them, their light is puft out preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what ſhall they do now? when the heart is furniſhed with this Grace of Contentment, this Grace is (as it were) the Lanthorn, and it keeps comfort in the ſpirit of a man, light in the midſt of a ſtorm and tempeſt. When you have a Lanthorn in the midſt of a ſtorm you can carry a light every where up and down the ſhip to the top of the Maſt if you will, and yet keep it light; ſo the comfort of a Chriſtian when it is enlivened with the Grace of Contentment, it may be kept light whatever ſtorms or tempeſts come, yet he can keep light in his ſoul, Oh! this helps thy comforts exceeding much.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>There is this excellency in Contentment, that it fetches in the comfort of thoſe things we have not really in poſſeſſion;</hi> and perhaps many that have not outward things have more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort than thoſe have that do enjoy them themſelves: As now a man by diſtilling herbs, though he hath not the herbs themſelves, yet having the water that is diſtill'd out of them, he may enjoy the benefit of the herbs: So though a man hath not the real poſſeſſion of ſuch an outward eſtate, an outward comfort, yet he by the grace of Contentment may fetch it in to himſelf. By the Art of Navigation we can fetch in the riches of the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies to ourſelves; ſo by the Art of Contentment we may fetch in the comfort of any condition to our ſelves, that is, we may have that comfort by Contentment, that we ſhould have if we had the thing it ſelf. There is a notable ſtory you have for this in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the life of <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> one <hi>Sineus</hi> comes to him, and would very fain have had him deſiſt from the wars, and not war with the Romans; ſaith he to him, May it pleaſe your Majeſty, it is reported that the Romans are very good men of War, and if it pleaſe the gods we do overcome them,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:132683:62"/>what benefit ſhall we have of that victory? <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> anſwered him, we ſhall ſtraight then conquer all the reſt of <hi>Italy</hi> with eaſe, ſaith <hi>Sineus,</hi> indeed it is likely which your Grace ſpeaketh, but when we have won <hi>Italy</hi> will then our wars end? If the gods were pleaſed <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> that the victory were atchieved, the way were then broad open for us to attain great conqueſts, for who would not afterwards go into <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage?</hi> But (ſaith <hi>Sineus</hi>) when we have all in our hands, what ſhall we do in the end? then <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> laughing, told him again, we will then be quiet, and take our eaſe, and make feaſts every day, and be as merry one with another as we can poſſible; ſaith <hi>Sineus,</hi> what letteth us now to be as quiet, and merry together, ſith we enjoy that preſently without further travel and trouble which we ſhould go ſeek for abroad, with ſuch ſhedding of blood, and ſo manifeſt danger, cannot you fit down and be merry now? ſo a man may think, if I had ſuch a thing, then I would have another, and if I had that, then you would have more, and what if you got all you deſire; then you would be content, why? you may be content now without them: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our Contentment doth not conſiſt in the getting of the thing we deſire, but in Gods faſhioning our ſpirits to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, there's ſome men that have not a foot of ground of their own, yet will live better than other men that are heirs to a great deal of land. I have known it in the Country ſometimes, that a man lives upon his own land, and yet lives very poorly, but you ſhall have another man that ſhall farm his land, and yet by his good husbandry, and by his care, ſhall live better ſometimes than he that hath the land of his own: So a man by this Art of Contentment may live better without an eſtate, than another man can of an eſtate: Oh! it adds exceeding much to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a Chriſtian: and that I may ſhew it further, there is more comfort in the Grace of contentment, than there is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poſſeſſions whatſoever; a man hath more comfort in being content without a thing; than he can have in the thing, that he in a diſcontented way doth deſire.</p>
               <p>You think if I had ſuch a thing then I ſhould be content. I ſay there is more good in Contentment, than there is in the thing that you would fain have to cure your diſcontent, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:132683:62"/>that I ſhall open in divers particulars. As thus.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I would fain have ſuch a thing, and then I could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but if I had it then it were but the creature that did help to my Contentment; but now it's the Grace of God in my ſoul that makes me content: and ſurely it is better to be content with the Grace of God in my ſoul, than with the enjoying of an outward comfort.</item>
                  <item>2. If I had ſuch a thing, indeed my eſtate might be better, but my ſoul would not be better; but by Contentment my ſoul is better, that would not be bettered by an eſtate, or lands, or friends; but Contentment makes my ſelf to be better: and therefore Contentment is a better portion than the thing is that I would fain have to be my portion.</item>
                  <item>3. If I get Content by having my deſire ſatisfied, that's but ſelf-love; but when I am Contented with the hand of God, and am willing to be at his diſpoſe, that comes from my love to God, in having my deſire ſatisfied, there I am contented through ſelf-love, but through the Grace of Contentment I come to be contented out of love to God; and is it not better to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from a principle of love to God, than from a principle of ſelf-love?</item>
                  <item>4. If I am contented becauſe I have that that I have a deſire to, perhaps I am contented in that one particular, but that one particular doth not furniſh me with Contentment in another thing? perhaps I may grow more dainty and nice, and froward in other things: if you give children what they would have in ſome things, they grow ſo much the more coy and dainty, and diſcontented if they have not other things that they would have; but if I have once overcome my heart, and am content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Grace of God in my heart, then this doth not content me onely in particular, but in general, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls me. I am diſcontented, and would fain have ſuch a thing, and afterwards I have it: now doth this prepare me to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in other things? No, but when I have gotten this Grace of Contentment I am prepar'd to be contented in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and thus you ſee that Contentment doth bring comfort to a mans life, fills a mans life full of comfort in this world; yea, the truth is, it is even Heaven upon Earth, why what is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:132683:63"/>Heaven, but the reſt and quiet of a mans ſpirit; what's the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial thing that is in Heaven, but reſt, and joy, that makes the life of Heaven, there's reſt, and joy, and ſatisfaction in God: ſo it's here in a contented ſpirit, there's reſt, and joy, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in God: In Heaven, there's ſinging praiſes to God; a contented heart is always praiſing and bleſſing God; thou haſt Heaven while thou art upon Earth when thou haſt a contented ſpirit, yea, in ſome regards it's better than Heaven. How is that you will ſay? there's ſome kind of honor that God hath in it, and ſome excellency that he hath not in Heaven, and that's this.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In Heaven there is no overcoming of temptations, they are not put to any trials by afflictions: there in Heaven they have exerciſe of Grace, but they have nothing but encouragement to it, and indeed thoſe that are there their grace is perfect, and in that they do excel us, but there is nothing to croſs their grace, they have no tryals at all to tempt them to do contrary; but now for a man or woman to be in the midſt of afflictions, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and troubles, and yet to have grace exerciſed, and yet to be ſatisfied in God and Chriſt, and in the Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the mid'ſt of all they ſuffer, this may ſeem to be an honor that God hath from us, that he hath not from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints in Heaven. Is it ſo much for one that is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that hath nothing elſe but good from God, hath nothing to try them, no temptations, is that ſo much for them to be praiſing and bleſſing God, as for the poor ſoul that is in the midſt of tryals and temptations, and afflictions, and troubles? for this ſoul to go on praiſing, and bleſſing, and ſerving God, (I ſay) it is an excellency that thou ſhalt not have in Heaven, and God ſhall not have this kind of glory from thee in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore be contented, and prize this Contentment, and be willing to live in this world as long as God ſhall pleaſe, and do not think, Oh that I were delivered from all theſe afflictions and troubles here in this world! if thou wert, then thou ſhouldeſt have more eaſe to thy ſelf: but here's a way of honoring God, and manifeſting the excellency of Grace here when thou art in this conflict of temptation that God ſhall not have from thee in Heaven, and therefore be ſatisfied and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:132683:63"/>quiet, be contented with thy Contentment: I want ſuch and ſuch things that others have, but bleſſed be God I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented heart that others have not, then I ſay be content with thy Contentment, for that's a rich portion that the Lord hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, if the Lord ſhould give unto thee thouſands here in this world, it would not be ſuch a rich portion as this, that he hath given thee a contented ſpirit: Oh go away and praiſe the name of God, and ſay, Lord, it's true, theſe and theſe comforts that others have I ſhould be glad if I had them, but thou haſt cut me ſhort, but though I want theſe, yet thou haſt given me that that is as good and better, thou haſt given me a quiet conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heart, to be willing to be at thy diſpoſe.</p>

               <p>The eight Excellency is, <hi>Contentment is a great bleſſing of God upon the ſoul.</hi> There is Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon thoſe that are content, the bleſſing of God is upon them, and their eſtates, and upon all that they have. We read in <hi>Deut.</hi> of the bleſſing of <hi>Judah</hi> the principle Tribe; this is the bleſſing of <hi>Judah, And he ſaid, hear Lord the voice of</hi> Judah, <hi>and bring him unto his people, let his hands be ſufficient for him, and be thou an help to him from his enemies.</hi> Let his hand

It is the Lord that gives us all things to enjoy, we may have the thing, and yet not enjoy it except God come in with his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, now whatſoever thou haſt, thou doſt enjoy it: Many men have eſtates and do not enjoy them, it's the bleſſing of God that gives us all things to enjoy, it is God that through his bleſſing, hath faſhioned thy heart and made it ſuitable to thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The ninth Excellency, <hi>Thoſe that are content, they may expect reward from God, that God ſhall give unto them the good of all thoſe things that they are contented to be without,</hi> and this brings in abundance of good to a contented ſpirit; There is ſuch and ſuch a mercy that thou thinkeſt would be very comfortable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee if thou hadſt it, but canſt thou bring thy heart to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to God in it; thou ſhalt have the bleſſing of the mercy one way or other; if thou haſt not the thing it ſelf in <hi>re,</hi> thou ſhalt have it made up one way or other, thou ſhalt have a Bill of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to receive ſomewhat in lieu of it, there is no comfort that any ſoul is content to be without, but the Lord will give either the comfort or ſomewhat in ſtead of it: Thou ſhalt have a reward to thy ſoul for what ever good thing thou art content to be without. You know what the Scripture ſaith of active obedience, and the Lord doth accept (of his ſervants) their will for the deed, though we do not do a good thing, yet if our hearts be upright, to will to do it, we ſhall have the bleſſing though we do not do the thing: You that complain of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you cannot do as others do, you cannot do as much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as others do, if your hearts be upright with God, and would fain do the ſame ſervice that you ſee others do; you would account it a great bleſſing of God upon you, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt bleſſing in the world if you were able to do as others do; now you may comfort your ſelves with this, having to deal with God in the way of the Covenant of Grace, you ſhall have from God the reward of all you would do, as a wicked man
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:132683:65"/>ſhall have puniſhment for all the ſin he would commit, ſo thou ſhalt have the reward for all the good thou wouldſt do. Now, may we not draw an argument from active obedience to paſſive? There is as good reaſon why thou ſhouldſt expect that God will reward thee for all thou art willing to ſuffer, as well as for all that thou art willing to do; now if thou beeſt willing to be without ſuch a comfort and mercy when God ſees it fit, thou ſhalt be no looſer, Certainly God will reward thee either with the comfort, or with that that ſhall be as good to thee as the comfort, therefore conſider, how many things have I that others want? and can I bring my heart into a quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented frame to want what others have? I have the Bleſſing of all that they have, and I ſhall either poſſeſs ſuch things as others have, or elſe God will make it up one way or other, either here or hereafter in eternity to me: Oh! what riches are here! with Contentment thou haſt all kind of riches.</p>
               <p>Tenthly and laſtly, <hi>By Contentment the ſoul comes to an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency neer unto God himſelf, yea the neereſt that may be,</hi> for this word that is Tranſlated <hi>Content,</hi> is a word that ſignifies a <hi>Self-ſufficiency</hi> (as I told you in the opening of the words.) A contented man is a ſelf-ſufficient man. What is the great glory of God, but to be happy and ſelf-ſufficient of himſelf! Indeed he is ſaid to be Al-ſufficient, but that's but a further addition of the word <hi>All,</hi> rather than of any matter; for to be ſufficient, is All-ſufficient: Now is this the Glory of God, to be Sufficient, to have Sufficiency in Himſelf, <hi>El-ſhaddai,</hi> to be God, having Sufficiency in himſelf? Now thou comeſt neer to this, thou par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takeſt of the Divine Nature, as by Grace in general, ſo in a more peculiar manner by this Grace of <hi>Chriſtian Contentment,</hi> what's the Excellency and Glory of God but this? Suppoſe there were no creatures in the world, and that all the creatures in the world were annihilated, God would remain the ſame bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God that he is now, he would not be in a worſe condition if all Creatures were gone; neither would a contented heart if God ſhould take away all creatures from him, a contented heart hath enough in the want of all creatures, and would not be more miſerable than now he is. Suppoſe that God ſhould continue thee here, and all creatures that are here in this world were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:132683:66"/>away, yet thou ſtill (having God to be thy portion) woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be as happy as now thou art, and therefore Contentation hath a great deal of Excellency in it.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſhewed in many particulars the Excellency of this Grace, laboring to preſent the beauty of it before your ſouls that you may be in love with it.</p>
               <p>Now my brethren what remains but the practice of this, for this Art of Contentment it's not a ſpeculative thing, onely for contemplation, but it is an art of Divinity, and therefore pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, ye are now to labor to work upon your hearts, that there may be this Grace in you, that you may honor God and honor your profeſſion with this Grace of Contentment, for there is none doth more honor God, and honor their profeſſion than thoſe that have this Grace of Contentment. Now that we may fall upon the practice, there is required,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That we ſhould be humbled in our hearts for the want of this, that we have had ſo little of this Grace in us.</hi> For there is no way to ſet upon any duty with profit, till the heart be humbled for the want of the performance of the duty before; many men when they hear of a duty they ſhould perform, they will labor to perform it, but firſt you muſt be humbled for the want of it, therefore that's the thing that I ſhall endeavor in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to get your hearts to be humbled for the want of this Grace; Oh had I had this Grace of Contentment, what a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py life I might have lived? what abundance of honor I might have brought to the Name of God, and how might I have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored my profeſſion? and what a deal of comfort might I have enjoyed, but the Lord knows it hath been far otherwiſe, Oh how far have I been from this grace of Contentment that hath been opened to me? I have had a murmuring, a vexing, and fretting heart within me, every little croſs hath put me out of temper and out of frame, Oh the boiſterouſneſs of my ſpirit, what a deal of evil doth God ſee in my heart, in the vexing and fretting of my heart, and murmuring and repining of my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Oh that God would make you to ſee it: Now to the end that you might be humbled for the want of this, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor in theſe particulars to ſpeak unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:132683:66"/>
Firſt, I ſhall ſet before you, <hi>The evil of a murmuring ſpirit, there is more evil then you are aware of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>I will ſhew you ſome aggravations of this evil,</hi> It's evil in all, but in ſome more than in others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>I ſhall labor to take away the Pleas that any murmuring diſcontented heart hath for this diſtemper of his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's theſe Three things in this Uſe of humiliation of the ſoul for the want of this Grace of Contentment.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, now at this time. The great evil that there is in a murmuring diſcontented heart.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, <hi>This thy murmuring and diſcontentedneſs it argues, much corruption that is in the ſoul;</hi> as Contentment ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues much Grace, and ſtrong Grace, and beautiful Grace? ſo this argues much Corruption, and ſtrong Corruption, and very vile Corruption in thy heart. As it is in a mans body, If a mans body be of that temper that every ſcratch of a pin makes his fleſh to rankle and to be a ſore, you will ſay, ſurely this mans body is very corrupt, his blood and fleſh is corrupt that every ſcratch of a pin ſhall make it ranckle, ſo it is in thy ſpirit; if every little trouble and affliction ſhall make thee diſcontented and make thee murmur, and even cauſe thy ſpirit within thee to ranckle; or as it is in a wound of a mans body, the evil of a wound it is not ſo much in the largneſs of the wound, and in the abundance of blood that comes out of the wound, but in the inflammation that there is in it, or in a fretting and corroding humor that is in the wound; an unskilful man when he comes and ſees a large wound in the fleſh, looks upon it as a dangerous wound. And when he ſees a great deal of blood guſh out, he thinks theſe are the evils of it, but when a Chyrurgion comes and ſees a great gaſh, ſaith he, this will be healed within a few days, but there's a leſs wound and there's an inflammation or a fretting humor that is in it, and this will coſt time (ſaith he) to cure, ſo that he doth not lay Balſom and healing Salves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, but his great care is to get out the fretting humor, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, ſo that the thing that muſt heal this wound it is ſome drink to purge? But (ſaith the patient) what good will this do to my wound? You give me ſomewhat to drink, and my wound is in my arm, or in my leg, what good will this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:132683:67"/>do that I put in my ſtomach? Yes, it purges out the fretting humor, or takes away the inflammation, and till that be taken away the ſalves can do no good. So it is juſt for all the world in the ſouls of men, it may be there is ſome affliction upon them that I compare to the wound; now they think that the greatneſs of the affliction is that which makes their condition moſt miſerable: Oh no, there is a fretting humor, an inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the heart, a murmuring ſpirit that is within thee, and that is the miſery of thy condition, and that muſt be purged out of thee before thou canſt be healed, and let God do with thee what he will, till he purges out that fretting humor thy wound will not be healed; a murmuring heart is a very ſinful heart, ſo that when thou art troubled for ſuch an affliction, thou hadſt need turn thy thoughts, rather to be troubled for the murmuring of thy heart, for that's the greateſt trouble, there is an affliction upon thee and that is grievous, but there is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring heart within, that's more grievous. Oh that we could but convince men and women that a murmuring ſpirit is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evil than any affliction; let the affliction be what it will be. We ſhall ſhew more afterward that a murmuring ſpirit is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of the evil, and the miſery of the miſery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The evil of murmuring is ſuch, that God when he would ſpeak of wicked men, and deſcribe them, and ſhew the brand of a wicked ungodly man or woman, he inſtances in this ſin in a more ſpecial manner:</hi> I might name many Scriptures but that Scripture in <hi>Jude</hi> is a moſt remarkable one, in the 14. verſe, and ſo forward, there it is ſaid, <hi>That the Lord comes with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all, and convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly finners have ſpoken against him.</hi> Mark here in this 15. verſe, there is four times mentioned ungodly ones; All that are <hi>ungodly</hi> among them, all their <hi>ungodly</hi> deeds which they have <hi>ungodly</hi> committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which <hi>ungodly</hi> ſinners have ſpoken againſt him: This is in the general. But now he comes in the particular to ſhew who theſe are, theſe are (ſaith he) Murmurers; that's the very firſt. Would you know who are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:132683:67"/>ungodly men, that God when he comes with ten thouſand of Angels ſhall come to puniſh for all their ungodly deeds that they do, and thoſe that ſpeak ungodly things againſt them? Theſe ungodly ones are Murmurers. Murmurers in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are put in the fore front of ungodly ones, its a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scripture, that the Lord when he ſpeaks of ungodly ones puts Murmurers in the very fore front of all, you had need look to your ſpirits, you may ſee that this Murmuring, which is the vice contrary to this Contentment is not ſo ſmall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as you think, you think you are not ſo ungodly as others, becauſe you do not ſwear and drink as others do, but you may be ungodly in Murmuring, its true, there is no ſin but ſome ſeeds and remainers of it are in thoſe that are godly, but when they are under the power of this ſin of murmuring, it doth convince them to be ungodly, as well as if they were under the power of drunkenneſs, or whoredom, or any other ſin, God will look upon you as ungodly for this ſin as well as for any ſin whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. This one Scripture ſhould make thy heart ſhake at the thought of the ſin of Murmuring.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As its made a brand of ungodly men, ſo you ſhal find in Scripture <hi>that God counts it rebellion,</hi> that is contrary to the worſhip that there was in contentedneſs: that is worſhipping of God crouching to God &amp; falling down before him, even as a dog that would crouch when you hold a ſtaff over him: but a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring heart its a rebellious heart, and that you ſhall find if you compare two Scriptures together, they are both in the Book of <hi>Numb</hi> 16.41. <hi>But on the morrow</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Children of Iſrael murmured againſt Moſes and againſt Aaron ſaying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord,</hi> They all murmured; now compare this with Chap. 17. and verſe 10. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes Bring Aarons rod again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the teſtimony to be kept for a token againſt the Rebels.</hi> In the 16. Chap. they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and in the 17. Chap. bring the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> again, before the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, for a token againſt the <hi>Rebels.</hi> So that to be a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murer, and to be a Rebel you ſee in Scripture phraſe is all one, it is a rebellion againſt God: as it is the beginning of rebellion and ſedition in a Kingdom when the people are diſcontent,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:132683:68"/>and when diſcontentment comes it grows to murmuring, and you can go into no houſe almoſt but there is murmuring when men are diſcontent, ſo that within a little while it breaks forth into ſedition or rebellion. Murmuring it's but as the ſmoak of the fire, there is firſt a ſmoak and ſmother before the flame breaks forth, and ſo before open rebellion in a Kingdom there is firſt a ſmoak of Murmuring, and then it breaks forth into open rebellion; but becauſe it hath rebellion in the ſeeds of it, therefore it is accounted before the Lord to be rebellion. Wilt thou be a Rebel againſt God; When thou feeleſt thy heart diſcontented and Murmuring againſt the diſpenſations of God towards thee, thou ſhouldeſt check thy heart thus, Oh thou wretched heart, what wilt thou be a Rebel againſt God? wilt thou riſe in a way of rebellion againſt the infinite God? yet thus thou haſt done, charge thy heart with this ſin of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, you that are guilty of this ſin of Murmuring you are this day by the Lord charged as being guilty of rebellion againſt him, and God expects that when you go home you ſhould humble your ſouls before him for this ſin, that you ſhould charge your ſouls for being guilty of rebellion againſt God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you may ſay, I never thought that I had been a Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God before, I thought that I had many infirmities, but now I ſee the Scripture ſpeaks of ſin in another manner than men do, the Scripture makes men (though but murmurers) to be Rebels againſt God, Oh this rebellious heart that I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord that hath manifeſted it's ſelf in this way of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt the Lord. That's a third particular in the evil of diſcontentment.</p>
               <p>A fourth particular in the evil of Diſcontentment, <hi>It is a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that is exceeding contrary to Grace, and eſpecially contrary to the work of God, in bringing of the ſoul home to himſelf;</hi> I know no diſtemper more oppoſite and contrary to the Work of God in converſion of a ſinner, than this is.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What's the work of God when he brings a ſinner home to himſelf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The uſual way is, for God to make the ſoul to ſee and be ſenſible of the dreadful evil that there is in ſin, and the great breach that ſin hath made between God and it, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:132683:68"/>Jeſus Chriſt can never be known in his beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency till the ſoul know that. I do not ſpeak what ſecret work of the holy Ghoſt there may be in the ſoul, but before the ſoul can actually apply Jeſus Chriſt to its ſelf, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but it muſt come to know the evil of ſin, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Jeſus Chriſt: there may be a ſeed of faith put into the ſoul, but the ſoul muſt firſt know Chriſt, and know ſin, and be made ſenſible of it. Now how contrary is this ſin of murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to any ſuch work of God; hath God made me ſee the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evil of ſin, and made my ſoul to be ſenſible of the evil of ſin as the greateſt burden? how can I then be ſo much troubled for every little affliction? Certainly if I ſaw what the evil of ſin was, that ſight would ſwallow up all other evils, and if I were burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the evil of ſin, it would ſwallow up all other burdens; what am I now murmuring againſt Gods hand (ſaith ſuch a ſoul) when as a while ago the Lord made me ſee my ſelf to be a damned wretch, and apprehend it as a wonder that I am not in Hell?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea, It's mighty contrary to the ſight of the infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and the things of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. What am I that ſoul that the Lord hath diſcovered ſuch infinite Excellency of Jeſus Chriſt to? and yet what ſhall I think ſuch a little affliction to be ſo grievous to me, when I have had the ſight of ſuch glory in Chriſt that is more worth than ten thouſand worlds? (for ſo will a true convert ſay) Oh! the Lord at ſuch a time hath given me that ſight of Chriſt that I would not be without for ten thouſand thouſand worlds; but hath God given thee that, and wilt thou be diſcontent for a trifle in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that?</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third work when God brings the ſoul home to himſelf it is, <hi>By taking the heart off from the Creature, the diſingaging the heart from all Greature-comforts:</hi> That is the Third work ordinarily that the ſoul may perceive of its ſelf. It's true, Gods Work may be altogether in the ſeeds in him, but in the ſeveral actings of the ſoul in turning to God it may perceive theſe things in it, the diſingagement of the heart from the Creature, that's the calling off the ſoul from the world, <hi>whom the Lord hath called he hath juſtified:</hi> What's the calling of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:132683:69"/>ſoul but this, the ſoul that was before ſeeking for Contentment in the world, and cleaving to the Creature, now the Lord cals the ſoul out of the world, and ſaith, Oh ſoul, thy happineſs is not here, thy reſt is not here, thy happineſs is elſewhere, and thy heart muſt be looſned from all theſe things that are here below in the world; and this is the work of God in the ſoul to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the heart from the Creature, and how contrary is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring heart to ſuch a thing; a thing that is glued to another you cannot take off, but you muſt rend it; ſo its a ſign thy heart is glued to the world, that when God would take thee off, thy heart rends, if God by an affliction ſhould come to take any thing in the world from thee, if thou canſt part from it with eaſe without rending, its a ſign then that thy heart is not glued to the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Fourth Work of God in converting of a ſinner, is this, <hi>The eaſting the ſoul upon Jeſus Chriſt for all its good:</hi> I ſee Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel the Fountain of all Good, and God out of free Grace tendering him to me for life, and for ſalvation, and now my ſoul caſts its ſelf, rouls its ſelf upon the infinite Grace of God in Chriſt for all good? now haſt thou done ſo? hath God converted thee, and drawn thee to his Son to caſt thy ſoul upon him for all thy good, and yet art thou diſcontented for the want of ſome little matter in a Creature-comfort? art thou he that hath caſt thy ſoul upon Jeſus Chriſt for all good? as he ſaith in another caſe, Is this thy faith?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The ſoul is ſubdued to God;</hi> and then it comes to receive Jeſus Chriſt as a King, to rule, to order and diſpoſe of him how he pleaſes, and ſo the heart is ſubdued unto God. Now how oppoſite is a murmuring diſcontented heart to a heart ſubdued to Jeſus Chriſt as a King, and receiving him as a Lord to rule and diſpoſe of him as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is in the work of thy turning to God, the giving up of thy ſelf to God in an everlaſting Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as thou takeſt Chriſt the head of the Covenant to be thine, ſo thou giveſt up thy ſelf to Chriſt; In the work of Converſion, there is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the ſoul wholly to God in an everlaſting Covenant to be his; haſt thou ever ſurrendred up thy ſelf to God in an everlaſting Covenant? then certainly this thy fretting, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:132683:69"/>heart is mighty oppoſite to it, certainly thou forgetteſt this Covenant of thine, and the Reſignation of thy ſelf up to God; It would be a marvellous help to you, to humble your ſouls when you are in a murmuring condition; if you could but obtain ſo much liberty of your own ſpirits as to look back to ſee what the work of God was in Converting you, there is nothing would prevail more than to think of that. I am now in a murmuring diſcontented way. But how did I feel my ſoul working when God did turn my ſoul to himſelf? Oh how op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite is this to that work, and how unbeſeeming? Oh what ſhame and confuſion would come upon the ſpirits of men and women, if they could but compare the work of corruption in their murmuring and diſcontent, with the work of God that was upon their ſouls in Converſion? Now we ſhould labour to keep the work of God upon our ſouls that was at our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; for Converſion muſt not be only at one inſtant at firſt, men are deceived in this, if they think their Converſion is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed meerly at firſt, thou muſt be in a way of Converſion to God all the days of thy life, and therefore Chriſt ſaith to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Except ye be converted and become as little children: <hi>Ye be converted:</hi> Why were they not converted before? Yes, they were converted, but they were to continue the work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion all the days of their lives, and what work of God there is at the firſt Converſion, it is to abide afterwards. As thus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways there muſt abide ſome ſight and ſenſe of ſin, it may be not in the way which you had, which was rather a preparation than any thing elſe; but the ſight and ſenſe of ſin it is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill, that is you are ſtill to be ſenſible of the burthen of ſin, as it is againſt the Holineſs and Goodneſs and Mercy of God unto thee, and the ſight of the Excellency of Jeſus Chriſt is to continue, and thy Calling out of the Creature, and the Caſting thy ſoul upon Chriſt as a King, ſtill receive him day by day, and the Subduing of thy heart, and the Surrendring of thy ſelf up to God in the way of Covenant; now if this were but daily continued, there would be no ſpace nor time for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring to work upon thy heart. Thats the Fourth Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culan.</p>
               <p>The Fifth thing in the evil of Diſcontentment, <hi>Murmuring
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:132683:70"/>and diſcontentment is exceeding below a Chriſtian:</hi> Oh! it is too mean and baſe a diſtemper for a Chriſtian to give place to it. Now it's below a Chriſtian in many reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How below the relation of a Chriſtian? The relation to which thou ſtandeſt. With what relation (you will ſay?)</p>
               <p>Firſt, The relation thou ſtandeſt in to God: Doſt not thou call God thy Father? and doſt not thou ſtand in relation to him as a childe? what, thou murmurer! In 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.4. It's a Speech of <hi>Jonadab</hi> to <hi>Ammon, Why art thou, being the Kings Son, lean from day to day, wilt thou not tell me?</hi> and ſo he told him; (but that was for a wicked cauſe) he perceived that his ſpirit was troubled, for otherwiſe he was of a fat and plump temper of body, but becauſe of trouble of ſpirit he was even pin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, why what's the matter? thou that ſtandeſt in this relation to the King, and yet any thing ſhould trouble thy heart (that's his meaning) is there any thing that ſhould diſquiet thy heart and yet ſtandeſt in ſuch a relation to the King, the Kings Son? So I may ſay to a Chriſtian, Art thou the Kings Son, the Son, the Daughter of the King of Heaven, and yet ſo diſquieted and troubled, and vext at every little thing that falls out? as if a Kings Son ſhould cry out, he is undone for loſing a bable, what an unworthy thing were this? So doſt thou, thou crieſt out as if thou wert undone, and yet a Kings Son, thou that ſtandeſt in ſuch relation to God, as unto a Father, thou doeſt diſhonor thy Father in this; as if ſo be either he had not wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or not power, or not mercy enough to provide for thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The relation that thou ſtandeſt in to Jeſus Chriſt, thou art the Spouſe of Chriſt:</hi> what! one married to Jeſus Chriſt and yet troubled and diſcontented. Haſt thou not enough in him? doth not Chriſt ſay to his Spouſe, as <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.8.) <hi>Am not I better to thee than ten ſons?</hi> So doth not Chriſt thy Husband ſay to thee, Am not I better to thee than thouſands of riches &amp; comforts? ſuch comforts as thou murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for want of; hath not God given thee his Son? and will he not with him give thee all things? hath the love of God been to thee to give thee his Son in way of marriage? why art thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented and murmuring? conſider thy relation to Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:132683:70"/>as thou art a Spouſe and married to him, his Perſon is thine, and ſo all the riches of Jeſus Chriſt is thine; as the riches of a husband are the wives, and though there are ſome husbands ſo vile as the wives may be forced to ſue for maintenance; certainly Jeſus Chriſt will never deny maintenance to his Spouſe: it's a diſhonor for a Husband to have his Wife go whining up and down; what, thou art match'd with Chriſt and art his Spouſe and wilt thou murmur now and be diſcontented in thy ſpirit? You ſhall obſerve among thoſe that are newly matched, when there is diſcontent between the wife and the husband, their friends will ſhake their heads and ſay, they do not meet with that that they did expect, ye ſee ever ſince they were married to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether how the man looks, and the woman looks, they are not ſo cheerily as they were wont to be, ſurely (ſay they) it is like to prove an ill match. But its not ſo here, it ſhall not be ſo between thee and Chriſt: Oh Jeſus Chriſt doth not love to ſee his Spouſe to have a lowring countenance: no man loves to ſee diſcontentment in the ſace of his Wife, ſurely Chriſt doth not love to ſee diſcontentment in the face of his Spouſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thou ſtandeſt in relation to Chriſt,</hi> not onely as a Spouſe but as a <hi>Member, Thou art bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh;</hi> and to have a Member of Jeſus Chriſt to be in ſuch a condition, its exceeding unworthy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He is thy Elder brother likewiſe, and ſo thou art a Co-heir with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The relation that thou ſtandeſt in to the Spirit of God,</hi> thou art the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, the holy Ghoſt is thy Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is he that is appointed to convey all comfort from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, to the ſouls of his people. And art thou the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, and doth he dwell in thee, and yet for all that thou murmureſt for every little matter?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The relation that thou ſtandeſt in to the Angels, thou art made one body with them:</hi> for ſo Chriſt hath joyned principalities and powers with his Church, they are Miniſtring Spirits for good to his people, to ſupply what they need, and thou, and they are joyned together, and Chriſt is the head of you and Angels.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The relation that you ſtand in to the Saints, you are of the ſame body with them,</hi> they and you make up but one myſtical body
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:132683:71"/>with Jeſus Chriſt, and if they be happy you muſt needs be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; On how beneath a Chriſtian is a Murmuring ſpirit if he conſiders his relations in which he ſtands.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Chriſtian ſhould conſider, <hi>That murmuring and diſcontentedneſs is below the high dignities that God hath put upon him:</hi> Do but conſider the high diguity that God hath put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee; the meaneſt Chriſtian in the world is a Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; he hath made us Kings unto himſelf, Kings unto God, not Kings unto men to rule over them, and yet I ſay every Chriſtian is a Lord of Heaven and Earth, yea of life and death. That is, As Chriſt he is a Lord of all, ſo he hath made thoſe that are his Members to be Lords of all, All are yours ſaith the Apoſtle, even life and death, every thing is yours. Its a very ſtrange expreſſion that death ſhould be theirs, Death is yours, that is, you are as it were Lords over it, you have that that ſhall make death to be your ſervant, your ſlave, even death it ſelf, your greateſt enemies are turned to be your ſlaves. Faith makes a Chriſtian to be as Lord over all, to be lifted up in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency above all creatures that ever God made, except the Angels, yea and in ſome reſpect above them, I ſay the pooreſt Chriſtian that lives is raiſed to an eſtate above all the Creatures in the world, except Angels, yea, and above them in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, too, and yet diſcontented, that thou who wert as a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of Hell, and might have been ſcorching and velling and roaring there to all eternity, yet that God ſhould raiſe thee to have a higher excellency in thee than there is in all the works of Creation that ever he made, except Angels, and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that are in thy condition, yea and thou art neerer the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature than the Angels, becauſe thy nature is joyned in an hypoſtatical union to the Divine Nature, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thy nature is more honored than the nature of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And the death of Chriſt is thine, he died for thee, and not for the Angels, and therefore thou art like to be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Angels in divers reſpects: yea, thou art in ſuch an eſtate as this is, thou that art ſet apart to the end that God might man feſt to all eternity what the infinite power of a Deity is able to raiſe a creature to; for thats the condition of a Saint, a Believer, his condition is ſuch as he is ſet apart to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:132683:71"/>end that God might manifeſt to all eternity what his infinite power is able to do to make the creature happy; art thou in ſuch a condition? Oh! how low and beneath this condition is a murmuring and diſcontented heart for want of ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts here in this world: How unſeemly is it that thou ſhouldeſt be a ſlave to every croſs, that every affliction ſhall be able to ſay to thy ſoul, Bow down to us: We accounted that a great ſlavery, when men would ſay to our ſouls, Bow down: As the cruel Prelates were wont to do in impoſing things upon mens conſciences, they did in effect ſay, Let your conſciences, your ſouls bow down to us, that we may tread upon them: that is the greateſt ſlavery in the world, that one man ſhould ſay to another, let your conſciences, your ſouls bow down that we may tread upon them; but wilt thou ſuffer every affliction to ſay, bow down that we may tread upon thee? Truly its ſo, when thy heart is overcome with murmuring and diſcontent: Know that thoſe afflictions which have cauſed thee to murmur, have ſaid to thee, Bow down that we may tread upon thee; nay, not afflictions, but the very Devil doth prevail againſt you in this: Oh! how beneath is this to the happy eſtate that God hath raiſed a Chriſtian unto! What! the ſon of a King ſhall he have every baſe fellow to come and bid him bow down that he may tread upon his neck? thus doeſt thou in every affliction: the affliction, the croſs, and trouble that doth befall thee, ſaith, Bow down that we may come and tread upon thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Murmuring its below the ſpirit of a Chriſtian.</hi> Below his Spirit, the ſpirit of every Chriſtian ſhould be like the ſpirit of his father; every father loves to ſee his ſpirit in his childe, loves to ſee his Image, not his Image of his body onely, to ſay, here's a childe for all the world like the father, but he hath the ſpirit of his father too: a father that is a man of ſpirit, Loves to ſee his ſpirit in his childe, rather than the feature of his Body: Oh the Lord that is our Father, loves to ſee his ſpirit in us: Great men love to ſee great ſpirits in their children, and the great God loves to ſee a great ſpirit in his Children; we are one Spirit with God, and with Chriſt, and one Spirit with the holy Ghoſt, therefore we ſhould have a ſpirit that might mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Glory of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;

                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:132683:73"/>thats the ſpirit of a Chriſtian indeed. The ſpirit of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould be a Lyon-like ſpirit, as Jeſus Chriſt is the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> (ſo he is called) ſo we ſhould manifeſt ſomewhat of the Lyon-like Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; he manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his Lyon-like Spirit in paſſing through all afflictions and troubles whatſoever, without any murmuring againſt God. When he came to drink that bitter cup, and even the dregs of it, he prayed to God (indeed) that if it were poſſible it might paſs from him, but preſently, Not my will, but thy will be done: As ſoon as ever he did mention the paſſing of the cup from him (though it were the moſt dreadful cup that ever was drunk ſince the world began,) yet at the mentioning of it, not my will, but thy will be done; here Chriſt ſhewed a Lyon-like Spirit, in going through all kind of afflictions whatſoever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any murmuring againſt God in them: Now a murmuring ſpirit is a baſe dejected ſpirit, croſs and contrary to the Spirit of a Chriſtian, and its very baſe. I remember that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens account it very baſe, <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth report of a certain people that did uſe to manifeſt their diſdain to men that were over-much dejected by any affliction, they did condemn them to this puniſhment, To wear womans cloathes all their dayes, or ſuch a ſpace of time at leaſt they ſhould go in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens cloaths in token of ſhame and diſgrace to them; becauſe they had ſuch effeminate ſpirits, they thought it againſt a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſpirit, and therefore ſeeing they did un-man themſelves they ſhould go as women. Now ſhall they account it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like ſpirit, to be over-much dejected in affliction: and ſhall not a Chriſtian account it an unchriſtian-like ſpirit to be over-much dejected by any affliction whatſoever? I remember ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compares murmuring ſpirits, to children when they are weaning, What a deal of ſtir have you with your children when you wean them? how froward and vexing are they? So when God would wean thee from ſome outward comforts in this world, Oh how fretting and diſcontented art thou! Children will not ſleep themſelves, not let their mothers ſleep when they are weaning; and ſo when God would wean us from the world, and we fret, vex, and murmur, this is a childiſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:132683:73"/>
Fourthly, <hi>Its below the profeſſion of a Chriſtian.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a Chriſtian, what's that? A Chriſtians profeſſion is, To be dead to the world, and to be alive to God, that's his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to have his life to be hid with Chriſt in God, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf in God; What, is this thy profeſſion? and yet if thou haſt not every thing that thou wouldeſt have, to murmur and be diſcontent, thou doſt in that even deny thy profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>It is below that ſpecial Grace of Faith.</hi> Faith is that that doth overcome the world, it is that that makes all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God to be ours: Now when thou tookeſt upon thee the profeſſion of Religion, Did God ever promiſe thee that thou ſhouldeſt live at eaſe, and quiet, and have no trouble? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion, What is this my faith? what did I ever promiſe thee (ſaith he) that thou ſhouldeſt ever flouriſh in the world? art thou a Chriſtian to that end? and is this thy faith? I never made any ſuch promiſe to thee when thou tookeſt upon thee to be a Chriſtian; Oh its mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thy profeſſion, thou haſt never a promiſe for this, that thou ſhouldeſt not have ſuch an affliction upon thee: And a Chriſtian ſhould live by his faith; it is ſaid, that the juſt doth live by faith: now thou ſhouldeſt not look after any other life but the life that thou haſt by faith; now thou haſt no ground for thy faith, to believe that thou ſhouldſt be delivered out of ſuch an affliction; and then, why ſhouldeſt thou account it ſuch a great evil to be under ſuch an affliction? Certainly that good that we have in the ground for our faith, it is enough to content our hearts here, and to all eternity: A Chriſtian ſhould be ſatisfied with that that God hath made to be the object of his faith, the object of his faith is high enough to ſatisfie his ſoul, were it capable of a thouſand times more than it is: Now if thou mayeſt have the object of thy faith full, thou haſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to content thy ſoul: and know that when thou art diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for want of ſuch and ſuch comforts, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt but think thus, God did never promiſe me that I ſhould have theſe comforts, and at this time, and in ſuch a way as I would have, but I am diſcontented becauſe I have not theſe which God did never yet promiſe me, and therefore I ſin much
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:132683:74"/>againſt the Goſpel, and againſt the Grace of Faith.</p>
               <p>There is yet another thing, Its below the hopes of Chriſtians: Oh! the moſt glorious things that the Saints hope for.</p>
               <p>And againſt the helps that Chriſtians have. Chriſtians have great helps that may help them againſt murmuring.</p>
               <p>And it is againſt that, which God expects from Chriſtians. God expects other manner of things from them than this.</p>
               <p>Yea, and it is below that that God hath from other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Theſe things I ſhall open at another time.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Mentioned divers things the laſt day to ſet out the evil of diſcontent; I ſhall name Two or Three more.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is below a Chriſtian in this, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its below thoſe helps that a Christian hath more than others have;</hi> they have the Promiſes to help them that others have not; its not ſo much to have a <hi>Nabal</hi> have his heart ſink, becauſe he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Creature to uphold him, but its much for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that hath Promiſes and Ordinances to uphold his ſpirit which others have not.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Its below the expectation that God hath of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> for God expects not onely that they ſhould be patient in afflictions, but that they ſhould rejoyce and triumph in them:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:132683:74"/>now Chriſtians, when God expects this from you, for you not ſo much as to have attained to contentedneſs under afflictions, Oh this is beneathe the expectation of God from you.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>It is below that that God hath had from other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Others have not onely been contented with little croſſes, but they have triumphed under great afflictions, they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the ſpoiling of their goods with joy, read but the latter part of the 11. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and you ſhall find what great things God hath had from his people, and therefore not to be content with ſmaller croſſes, this muſt needs be a great evil.</p>
               <p>The Sixth evil that there is in a murmuring ſpirit, is this, <hi>By murmuring you undo your prayers, for it is exceeding contrary to the prayers you make unto God:</hi> When you come to prayer to God, you acknowledge his Soveraignty over you, you come there to profeſs your ſelves to be at Gods diſpoſe, what do you pray for except you acknowledg that you are at his diſpoſe, except you will ſtand (as it were) at his diſpoſe, never come to petition to him, if you will come to petition to him, and yet will be your own carver, you go croſs to your prayers, to come as if you would beg your bread at your Fathers gates every day, and yet you muſt do what you liſt, this is the undoing of the prayers of a Chriſtian. I remember I have read of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> that ſpeaking concerning <hi>Peter</hi> that he denied his Maſter (ſaith he) <hi>Peter</hi> forgot his <hi>pater-noſter,</hi> for that was <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> and <hi>thy Kingdom come:</hi> So we may ſay, when you have murmuring and diſcontented hearts, you forget your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, you forget what you have prayed for, for you muſt make the Lords Prayer to be as a pattern for your Prayers, though you ſay not alwayes the ſame words, what do you pray, <hi>but give us this day our daily bread?</hi> for thats Chriſts intention that we ſhould have that as a pattern, and is a directory (as it were) how to make your prayers; now God doth not teach any of you to pray, Lord give us ſo much a yeer, or let me have ſuch kind of cloth, and ſo many diſhes at my table, Chriſt doth not teach you to pray ſo, but he teaches us to pray, <hi>Lord give us our bread,</hi> ſhewing that you ſhould be content with a little: What have you not bread to eat? I hope there's none of you here but have that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:132683:75"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But I do not know if I ſhould die what ſhould become of my Children: Or if I have bread now I know not where I ſhall have it the next week, or where I ſhall have proviſion for the Winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Where did Chriſt teach us to pray, Lord give us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for ſo long a time? no, but if we have bread for this day Chriſt would have us content: Therefore when we murmur be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have not ſo much variety as others have, we do (as it were) forget out <hi>Pater-noster;</hi> Its againſt our prayers, we do not in our lives hold forth the acknowledgement of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God over us as we ſeem to acknowledge in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; therefore when at any time you find your hearts murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then do but reflect upon your ſelves and think thus, Is this according to my prayers, wherein I held forth the Soveraign Power and Authority that God hath over me?</p>
               <p>The ſeventh thing that I adde for the evil of diſcontentment, is, <hi>The woful effects that comes to a diſcontented heart from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.</hi> I'le name you five: There are five evil effects that comes from a murmuring ſpirit.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>By murmuring and diſcontent in your hearts, you come to loſe a great deal of time;</hi> How many times do men and women when they are diſcontented let their thoughts run, and are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and contriving through their preſent diſcontentedneſs; then let their diſcontented thoughts be working in them, for ſome hours together, and they ſpend their time in vain. When you are alone you ſhould ſpend your time in holy meditation, but you are ſpending your time in diſcontented thoughts; you who complain that you cannot meditate, you cannot think on good things, but if you begin to think of them a little, preſently your thoughts are off from them, but if you be diſcontented with any thing, then you can go alone. and muſe and roll things up and down in your thoughts to feed a diſcontented humor: Oh la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to ſee this evil effect of murmuring, the loſing of your time.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>It doth unfit a man for duty:</hi> A man or woman that is in a contented frame, you may turn ſuch a one to any thing at any time, he is fit for to go to God at any time; but when one is in a diſcontented condition, then a man or woman is exceeding
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:132683:75"/>unfit for the ſervice of God. And it cauſes many diſtractions in duty, it unfits for duty, and when you come to perform duties, Oh the diſtractions that are in your duties, when your ſpirits are diſcontented; when you hear of any ill news from Sea and cannot bear it, or of any ill from a friend, or any loſs or croſs, Oh what diſtractions do they cauſe in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of holy duties! When you ſhould be enjoying communion with God, you are diſtracted in your thoughts about the croſs that hath befallen you, whereas had you but a quiet ſpirit, though there ſhould great croſſes befall you, yet they would never hinder you in the performance of any duty.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Conſider what wicked riſings of heart, and reſolutions of ſpirit there are many times in a diſcontented fit.</hi> In ſome diſcontented fits the heart riſes againſt God, and againſt others, and ſometimes hath even deſperate reſolutions what to do to help themſelves. If the Lord ſhould have ſuffered you to have done (ſometimes in a diſcontented fit) what you had thought to do, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful miſery had you brought upon your ſelves: Oh it was a mercy of God that did ſtop you, had not God ſtopt you, but let you go on when you thought to help your ſelves this way and the other way, Oh it had been ill with you, do you but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thoſe riſings of heart and wicked reſolutions that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you have had in a diſcontented mood, and learn to be humbled upon that.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankfulneſs, that's an evil and a wicked effect that comes from diſcontent.</hi> Unthankfulneſs the Scripture doth rank among very great ſins. For men and women that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content though they injoy many mercies from God, yet they are thankful for none of them, for this is the vile nature of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, to leſſen every mercy of God, to make thoſe mercies they have from God to be as nothing to them, becauſe they have not what they would have. Sometimes its ſo even in ſpiritual things, if they have not all they would have, the comforts that they would have, then what they have is nothing to them, do you think that God will take this well? If you ſhould give a friend, a kinſman, a purſe of money to go and trade withall, and he ſhould come and ſay, What do you give
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:132683:76"/>me? they are but a few counters, they will do me no good: you cannot bear this at his hand if he ſhould do ſo, becauſe he hath not ſo much money as he would: So for you to be ready to ſay, All that God hath given me is nothing worth, will do me no good, they are but counters; though they are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Graces of Gods ſpirit, that are more worth than thouſands of worlds, yet for you to ſay, they are nothing, they are but common gifts, and all is but in hypocriſie, all counterfeit, Oh! what an unthankful thing is this! the Graces of Gods Spirit are nothing to a diſcontented heart that hath not all that it would have; and ſo for outward bleſſings, though God hath given you health of Body, and ſtrength, and bath given you ſome competency for your family, ſome way of lively-hood, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are diſappointed in ſomewhat that you would have, therefore all is nothing unto you; Oh! what unthankfulneſs is here? God expects that every day you ſhould ſpend ſome time in bleſſing his Name for what mercy he hath granted unto you, there's not any one of you who are in the loweſt condition, but you have abundance of mercies to bleſs God for, but diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs makes them nothing. Its an excellent ſpeech that I remember <hi>Luther</hi> hath (ſaith he) This is the Rhetorick of the Spirit of God (its a very fine ſpeech of his) to extenuate evil things, and to amplifie good things; if there falls out a croſs, to make the croſs to be but little, but if there be a mercy to make the mercy to be great; as thus, If there be a croſs, if the Spirit of God prevails in the heart, ſuch a man or woman will wonder that it is no greater, and will bleſs God that though there be ſuch a croſs, yet that it is no more; that's the work of the Spirit of God: and if there be a mercy, wonders at Gods goodneſs that God granted ſo great a mercy: The Spirit of God extenuates evils and croſſes, and doth magnifie and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie all mercies, and makes all mercies ſeem to be great, and all afflictions ſeem to be little. But (ſaith he) the Devil goes quite contrary, the Rhetorick of the Devil is quite otherwiſe, he doth leſſen Gods mercies, and amplifie evil things, as thus, A godly man wonders at his croſs that it is no more, a wicked man wonders his croſs is ſo much, Oh (ſaith he) none was ever ſo afflicted as I am! If there be a croſs, the Devil puts the ſoul
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:132683:76"/>upon muſing on it, and making it greater than it is, and ſo it brings diſcontent: And then on the other ſide, if there be a mercy then its the Rhetorick of the Devil to leſſen the mercy, Indeed (ſaith he) the thing is a good thing, but what is it? It is no great matter, and for all this I may be miſerable. Thus the Rhetorick of Satan doth leſſen Gods mercies, and doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe afflictions: And for this I'le give you a notable example that we have in Scripture, it is the example of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> In <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.12, 13. <hi>And Moſes ſent to call Dathan and Abiram the ſons of Eltab: which ſaid, We will not come up. Is it a ſmall thing that thou haſt brought us up out of a Land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderneſs, except thou make thy ſelf altogether a Prince over us?</hi> Mark, they ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Land that they were going into, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was the Land that God promiſed them that ſhould flow with milk and hony: But mark here their diſcontentedneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they met with ſome troubles in the wilderneſs, Oh it was to ſlay them, they made their affliction in the wilderneſs to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it was, Oh it was to kill them, though it were indeed to carry them to the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But now their deliverance from Egypt though it was a great mercy, they made that mercy to be nothing, for ſay they, You have brought us out of a Land that floweth with milk and honey, what land was that? It was the land of Egypt, the Land of their bondage, but they call it a Land that flowed with milk and honey, though it were the Land of their moſt cruel and unſupportable bondage; whereas they ſhould have bleſſed God as long as they had liv'd for Gods delivering them out of the Land of Egypt, yet meeting with ſome croſs, they make their deliverance from Egypt no mercy; no, it was rather a miſery to them, Oh (ſay they) Egypt was a Land that flowed with milk and honey. Oh what baſeneſs is there in a diſcontented ſpirit! a diſcontented ſpirit out of envy to Gods Grace will make mercies that are great to be little, yea to be none at all. Would one ever have thought that ſuch a word ſhould have come from the mouth of an Iſraelite, that had been under bondage and cried under it, and yet when they meet with a little croſs in their way to ſay, you have brought us out of the Land that floweth with milk and honey, to ſay they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:132683:77"/>were better before than now, and yet before they could not be contented neither; this is the uſual unthankful expreſſion of a diſcontented heart: And it is ſo with us now when we meet with any croſs in our eſtates, and taxations and troubles, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if any among you have been where the enemy hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, you are ready to ſay, We had plenty before, and we are now brought to a condition of hardſhip, we were better before when we had the Prelates and others to domineer: and ſo we indanger our ſelves to be brought into that bondage again; Oh let us take heed of this, of a diſcontented heart, there is this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful curſed fruit of diſcontent to make men and women unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for all the mercies God hath granted to them, and this is a ſore and grievous evil.</item>
                  <item>And laſtly, <hi>There's this evil effect in murmuring, It cauſes ſhiftings of ſpirit:</hi> they that murmur and are diſcontent, are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to temptations, to ſhift for themſelves in ſinful and ungodly ways, diſcontent is the ground of ſhitting courſes and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ways. How many of you may have your conſciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you of this, that you in the time of your afflictions have ſought to ſhift for your ſelves by wayes that have been ſinful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and your diſcontent was the bottom and ground of it? If you would avoid ſhiftings for your ſelves by wicked ways, labor to mortifie this ſin of diſcontent, to mortifie it at the root.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Eight evil that there is in murmuring and diſcontent is this, <hi>There is a great deal of folly, extream folly in a diſcontented heart, its a fooliſh ſin.</hi> I ſhall open the folly of it in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>It takes away the preſent comfort of what you have, becauſe you have not ſomwhat that you would have.</hi> What a fooliſh thing is this, that becauſe I have not what I would have, I will not enjoy the comfort of what I have? Do not you account this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your children, you give them ſome victuals and they are not contented, perhaps (they ſay) its not enough, they cry for more, and if you do not preſently give them more they will throw away that they have, and though you account that folly in your Children, yet you deal thus with God; God gives you many mercies, but you ſee others have more mercies
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:132683:77"/>than you, and therefore you cry for more; I but God gives you not what you would have, and upon that you throw away what you have, Is not this folly in your hearts? It is unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
                  <item>2. There's a great deal of folly in diſcontentment, for <hi>by all your diſcontent you cannot help your ſelves,</hi> you cannot get any thing by it. Who can by taking any carking care <hi>add one cubit to his ſtature, or make one hair that is white, to be black?</hi> You may vex and trouble your ſelves, but you can get nothing by it. Do you think that the Lord will come in a way of mercy ever a whit the ſooner becauſe of the murmuring of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? Oh no, but mercy will be rather deferred the longer for it; though the Lord were before in a way of mercy, yet this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of your hearts were enough to put him out of his courſe of mercy, and though he had thoughts that you ſhould have the thing before, yet now you ſhall not have it. If you had a mind to give ſuch a thing to your child, yet if you ſee him in a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented fretting way, you will not give it him; and this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon why there are ſo many mercies denied to you, becauſe of your diſcontentment, you are diſcontented for want of them, and therefore you have them not, you do deprive your ſelves of the enjoyment of your own deſires becauſe of the diſcontent of your hearts, becauſe you have not your deſires, And is not this a fooliſh thing?</item>
                  <item>3. There's a great deal of folly in this, <hi>There are many fooliſh carriages commonly that a diſcontented hear is guilty of: They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves fooliſhly towards God and towards men;</hi> there are ſuch expreſſions, and ſuch kind of behavior comes from them, as makes their friends to be aſhamed of them many times; their carriages are ſo unſeemly, they are a ſhame to themſelves, and their friends.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>There is a great deal of folly in diſcontent and murmuring: for it doth eat out the good and ſweetneſs of a mercy before it comes.</hi> If God ſhould give a mercy that we are diſcontented for the want of, yet the bleſſing of the mercy is as it were eaten out before we come to have it. Diſcontent is like a worm that eats the meat out of the Nut, and when the meat is eaten out of it, then you ſhall have the ſhell. If a childe ſhould cry for a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:132683:78"/>Nut that hath the meat eaten out, or all worm-eaten, what good would the child have by having the Nut? ſo ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort you would fain have, &amp; you are troubled for the want of it, but the very trouble of your ſpirit, is the worm that eats out the bleſſing of the mercy, and then perhaps God gives it you, but gives it you with a curſe mixed with it, that you were better not have it; than have it. That man or woman that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for want of ſome good thing, if God doth give that good thing to them before they be humbled for their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that did proceed from them, ſuch a man or woman can have no comfort of the mercy, but it will be rather an evil than a good to them: And therefore for my part if I ſhould have a friend or brother, or one that were as dear to me as my own ſoul that I ſhould ſee diſcontented for the want of ſuch a comfort, I ſhould rather pray, Lord keep this thing from them, till thou wilt be pleaſed to humble their hearts for their diſcontent, let not them have the mercy till they come to be humbled for their diſcontent for the want of it, for if they have it before that time; they will have it without any bleſſing: And therefore it ſhould be your care when you finde your hearts diſcontented for want of anything, to be humbled for it, thinking thus with your ſelves, Lord, if that that I do ſo immoderately deſire, ſhould come to me before I be humbled for my diſcontent for want of it, I am certain I can have no comfort of it, but I ſhall rather have it as an affliction to me. Many things which you deſire as your lives, and think that you ſhould be happy if you had them, yet when they do come, you find not ſuch happineſs in them, but they prove to be the greateſt croſſes and afflictions to you that ever you had, and upon this ground, becauſe your hearts were immoderately ſet upon them before you had them. As it was with <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſhe muſt have children or elſe ſhe died, well ſaith God, ſeeing you <hi>muſt,</hi> you ſhall have them, but though ſhe had a childe ſhe died according to what ſhe ſaid, <hi>Give me children or elſe I die.</hi> So in regard of any other outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, people may have the thing, but often-times they have it ſo as it proves the heavieſt croſs to them that ever they had in all their lives, ſuch a childe as you were diſcontent for the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:132683:78"/>want of it, it may be it was ſick, and your hearts were out of temper for fear that you ſhould loſe it, and God reſtores it, but he reſtores it ſo as he makes it a croſs to your hearts all the days of your lives. One obſerves concerning <hi>Manna,</hi> when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were contented with their allowance that God allowed them, then it was very good, but when they would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Gods allowance, but would gather more then God would have them; then (ſaith the text) there was worms in it: So when we are content with our conditions, and that which God diſpoſes of us to be in, there's a bleſſing in it, then its ſweet to us, but if we muſt needs have more, and keep it longer than God would have us to have it, then there will be worms in it, and no good at all.</item>
                  <item>5, <hi>There's a great deal of folly in diſcontentedneſs, for it makes our affliction a great deal worſe than otherwiſe it would be;</hi> it no way removes our affliction, nay, while they do continue they are a great deal the worſe and heavier, for a diſcontented heart is a proud heart, and a proud heart will not pull down his ſails when there comes a tempeſt and ſtorm: If a Martinet when a tempeſt and ſtorm comes ſhould be froward and would not pull down his ſails, but is diſcontented with the ſtorm, Is his condition the better becauſe he is diſcontented and will not pull down his ſails? Will this help him? Juſt ſo it is for all the world with a diſcontented heart, a diſcontented heart is a proud heart, and he out of his pride is troubled with his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and is not contented with Gods diſpoſe, and ſo he will not pull down his ſpirit at all, and make it bow to God in this condition in which God hath brought him; now is his condition the better becauſe he will not pull down his ſpirit? No certainly abundantly worſe, a thouſand to one but the tempeſt and ſtorm overwhelms his ſoul. And thus you ſee what a great deal of folly there is in the ſin of diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The ninth evil of murmuring and diſcontentment is this, <hi>There is a mighty deal of danger in the ſin of diſcontentment, for it exceedingly provoketh the wrath of God;</hi> its a ſin that doth much provoke God againſt his creature; we find moſt ſad expreſſions in Scripture (and examples too) how God hath been provoked
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:132683:79"/>againſt many for their diſcontent; in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. you have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table text, and one would think that that were enough for ever to make you fear murmuring, in the 26. verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſpake unto Moſes and Aaron, ſaying,</hi> what did he ſay? <hi>How long ſhall I bear with this evil Congregation which murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me?</hi> How long ſhall I bear with them ſaith God, <hi>This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Congregation;</hi> Oh thats an evil Congregation that murmurs againſt me! And how long ſhall I bear with them? they do mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and they have murmured: as thoſe that have murmuring ſpirits &amp; murmuring diſpoſitions, they will murmur again, and again, <hi>How long ſhall I bear with this evil Congregation that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt me?</hi> How juſtly may God ſpeak of many of you that are this morning before the Lord, How long ſhall I bear with this wicked man or woman that doth murmur againſt me, and hath uſually in the courſe of their lives murmured againſt me, when any thing falls out otherwiſe than they would have it? And mark what follows after, <hi>I have heard the murmuring of the Children of Iſrael:</hi> You murmur, it may be others hear you not, nay, it may be you ſpeak not at all, or but half words, yet God hears the language of your murmuring hearts, and thoſe muttering ſpeeches, and thoſe half words that come from you. And further obſerve in this verſe; how the Lord repeats this ſin of murmuring, <hi>How long ſhall I bear with this evil Congregation which murmur againſt me?</hi> Secondly, <hi>I have heard their murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>which they murmur againſt me: Murmur, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, Murmur,</hi> Three times in one verſe he repeats it; and this is to ſhew his indignation againſt the thing: When you expreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt a thing, you will repeat it over again, &amp; again; now the Lord, becauſe he would expreſs his indignation againſt this ſin, he repeats it over again, and again, and it follows in ver. 28. <hi>Say unto them, as truely as I live ſaith the Lord, As ye have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in mine ears, ſo will I do to you.</hi> Mark, God ſwears againſt a murmurer; ſometimes in your diſcontent you will be ready to ſwear (it may be) do you ſwear in your diſcontent? So doth God ſwear againſt you for your diſcontent. And what was it that God would do unto them? ver. 29, 30. <hi>Doubtleſs your carkaſſes ſhall fall in the wilderneſs, and you ſhall not come into the Land concerning which I ſware, to make you dwell therein:</hi> as if God
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:132683:79"/>ſhould ſay, if I have any life in me, your lives ſhall go for it, as I live it ſhall coſt you your lives. A diſcontented murmuring fit of yours may coſt you your lives. You ſee how it provokes God, there is more evil in it than you are aware of, it may coſt you your lives, and therefore look to your ſelves, and learn to be humbled at the very beginnings of ſuch diſtempers in the heart. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.24, 25. <hi>Yea, they deſpiſed the pleaſant Land, they believed not his word; but murmured in their tents, and hearkned not unto the voice of the Lord; therefore he lifted up his hand againſt them to overthrow them in the wilderneſs.</hi> Here are divers things obſervable in this Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That which we ſpoke to before, How a murmuring heart doth ſlight Gods mercies, ſo it is here, <hi>They deſpiſed the pleaſant Land:</hi> and that a murmuring heart is contrary to faith, <hi>they believed not his word,</hi> but (ſaith the text) <hi>they murmred in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.</hi> Many men and women will hearken to the voice of their own baſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring hearts, that will not hearken to the voice of the Lord; if you would hearken to the voice of the Lord, there would not be ſuch murmuring as there is: but mark what follows upon it, you may not think to pleaſe your ſelves in your murmuring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedneſs, and think that no evil ſhall come of it; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lifted up his hand againſt them to overthrow them:</hi> you that are diſcontented, you lift up your hearts againſt God, and you cauſe God to lift up his hand againſt you; perhaps God laies his finger upon you ſoftly in ſome afflictions that are upon you in your families or elſewhere, and you cannot bear the hand of God that lies upon you as tenderly as a tender-hearted Nurſe that laies her hand upon the childe, you cannot bear the tender hand of God that is upon you in a leſſer affliction; it were juſt with God to lift up his hand againſt you in another manner of affliction; Oh a murmuring ſpirit provokes God exceedingly. There is another place in 16. of <hi>Numb.</hi> compare the 41. verſ. and the 46. verſ. together, <hi>But on the morrow all the Congregation of the Children of Iſrael murmured againſt Moſes and againſt Aaron ſaying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord:</hi> And mark in the 46. verſe, <hi>And Moſes ſaid unto Aaron, Take a Cenſer and put fire therein from off the Altar, and put on incenſe, and go quickly unto
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:132683:80"/>the Congregation and make an atonement for them, for there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the plague is begun;</hi> mark how Gods wrath is kindled; in the 41. verſe, the Congregation had murmured; and they murmured but againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> (perhaps you murmur more directly againſt God) and that was againſt God in murmuring againſt Gods Miniſters, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God but not ſo directly; but it may be the murmuring of your hearts is more directly againſt Gods dealings with you: if you murmur againſt thoſe that God makes inſtruments (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not every thing that you would have) as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament, or ſuch and ſuch that are publike In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, its againſt God; it was but againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> that the Iſraelites murmured, and they ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had killed the people of the Lord, though it was the hand of God that was upon them for their former wickedneſs, in murmuring. It is uſual for wicked vile hearts to deal thus with God, that when Gods hand is a little upon them for to murmur again and again, and ſo to bring upon themſelves even infinite kind of evils? but now the anger of God was quickly kindled, Oh ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Go take the Cenſer quickly, for wrath is gone out from Jehovah, the plague is begun; ſo while you are murmuring in your families, the wrath of God may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go out againſt you, quickly, in a morning or evening, when you are a murmuring, the wrath of God may come quickly out upon your families or perſons; you are never ſo prepared for preſent wrath as when you are in a murmuring diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fit, thoſe that ſtand by and ſee you in a murmuring diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented fit, have cauſe to ſay, Oh let us go and take the Cenſer, let us go to prayer, for we are afraid that wrath is gone out againſt this family, againſt this perſon: And it were a very good thing for thee that art a godly wiſe when you ſee your husband come home and fall to murmuring, becauſe things go not according to his deſire, to go to prayer, and ſay, Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the ſin of my husband: and ſo for the husband to go to God in prayer falling down and beſeeching of him that wrath may not come out againſt his family for the murmuring of his wife. And the truth is, at this day there hath been (at leaſt lately) as much murmuring in <hi>England</hi> as ever was,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:132683:80"/>and even in this very particular the plague is begun, and this very judgement it doth come many times upon murmuring, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that are ſo diſcontented in their families, &amp; are always grumbling and murmuring at any thing that falls out amiſs (I ſay) this text of Scripture in <hi>Numbers</hi> doth cleerly hold forth this, That the Lord brings the Plague upon men for this ſin of murmuring, he doth it in Kingdoms and Families, and upon particular perſons. Though we cannot always point out the particular ſin that God brings this for, yet this ſhould be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined how far we are guilty of this ſin of murmuring; becauſe the Scripture holds forth this ſo clearly, that <hi>Moſes</hi> when he did but hear that they murmured, Do they murmur? (ſaith he) Go forth quickly, and ſeek to pacifie the anger of God, <hi>For wrath is gone out, and the plague is begun.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. there you have a notable example of Gods heavy diſpleaſure againſt murmuring, <hi>Neither murmur ye as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer.</hi> Take heed of murmuring as ſome of them did (he ſpeaks of the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in the wilderneſs) but ſaith he, what came of it? <hi>They were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer.</hi> Now the deſtroyer is thought to be the fiery Serpents that were ſent among them: They murmured, and God ſent fiery Serpents to ſting them. What do you think that ſuch a croſs and affliction doth ſting you? Perhaps ſuch an affliction is upon you, and it ſeems to be grievous for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, What? do you murmur and repine? God hath greater croſſes to bring upon you: Thoſe people that murmur for the want of outward comforts, for want of water (ſometimes) and for the want of bread, they murmur, but the Lord ſends fiery Serpents among them. I may ſay to a murmuring heart, <hi>Wo to thee that Striveſt with thy Maker:</hi> Wo to that man, that woman that ſtrives againſt their Maker; What doeſt thou elſe, but ſtrive againſt thy Maker? Thy Maker hath the abſolute diſpoſe of thee, and wilt thou ſtrive againſt thy Maker? What doth this murmuring diſcontented heart of thine do otherwiſe but wrangle, and contend, and ſtrive, even with God himſelf? Oh wo to him that ſtrives againſt his Maker! I may further ſay to thee, as God ſpeaks to <hi>Job: Job</hi> 38.1.2. When <hi>Job</hi> was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, <hi>Now God ſpake</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>out of the whirlwind,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:132683:81"/>and ſaid, who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> So doeſt thou ſpeak againſt Gods ways, and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that hath fallen out concerning thy eſtate and outward comforts? who is this; <hi>who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> Where's that man or woman whoſe hearts are ſo bold and impudent, as dare ſpeak againſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Gods providence?</p>
               <p>The tenth Evil of murmuring and diſcontent is this, <hi>There's a great curſe of God upon it, ſo far as it doth prevail in one that is wicked, it hath the curſe of God upon it.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.15. ſee there what the curſe of God is upon wicked and ungodly men, <hi>Let them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</hi> That is the imprecation and curſe upon wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, that if they be not ſatisfied they ſhall grudge; when thou art not ſatisfied in thy deſires and findeſt thy heart grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God, apply this Scripture, What, is the curſe of the wicked upon me? This is the curſe that is threatned upon wicked and ungodly ones, That they ſhall grudge if they be not ſatisfied. And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.67. There it's threatned as a curſe of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, that they cannot be content with their preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>But they ſhall ſay in the morning, would God it were even; and at even, would God it were morning;</hi> and ſo they lie toſſing up and down and cannot be content with any condition that they are in, becauſe of the ſore afflictions that be upon them; and therefore it is further threatned as a curſe upon them, in the 34. verſ. <hi>That they ſhould be mad for the ſight of their eyes which they ſhould ſee:</hi> This is but the extremity of their diſcontentedneſs: that is, They ſhall be ſo diſcontented; as they ſhall be even mad. Many men and women in diſcontented moods are mad kind of people, and though you may pleaſe your ſelves in ſuch a mad kind of behavior, yet know, that it is a curſe of God upon men to be given up to a kind of madneſs for evils that they-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are upon them, and that they fear. In the 47. verſ. there is a notable expreſſion for to ſhew the curſe of God upon mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring hearts; the Lord threatning the curſes that ſhall be upon them (ſaith he) verſe, 45, 46, and 47. <hi>The Curſo ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thee, and they ſhall be upon thee for a ſign, and for a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and upon thy ſeed for ever: Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:132683:81"/>Lord thy God with joyfulneſs, and with gladneſs of heart for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all things.</hi> God here threatens to bring his curſe ſo upon them, as to make them a wonder and a ſign to others, Why? <hi>becauſe they have not ſerved the Lord with joyfulneſs of heart</hi> (that may be added to that of the wrath of God upon men) therefore God would bring ſuch a curſe upon them as would make them a wonder to all that were about them. Oh how far art thou then that haſt a murmuring heart, from ſerving the Lord with joyfulneſs?</p>
               <p>The eleventh evil of diſcontent and murmuring is this, <hi>There is much of the ſpirit of Satan in a murmuring ſpirit.</hi> The Devil is the moſt diſcontented creature that is in the world; He is the proudeſt creature that is, and the diſcontentedſt creature, and the moſt dejected creature. Now therefore ſo much diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as thou haſt, ſo much of the ſpirit of Satan thou haſt. It was the unclean ſpirit that went up and down and found no reſt; ſo when a man or womans ſpirit hath no reſt, it is a ſign that it hath much of the unclean ſpirit, of the ſpirit of Satan. And thou ſhouldeſt think this with thy ſelf, Oh Lord what have I the ſpirit of Satan upon me: It is Satan that is the moſt diſcontented ſpirit that is, and Oh! how much of his ſpirit have I upon me that can find no reſt at all?</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Murmuring and diſcontent hath this evil in it, <hi>There is an abſolute neceſſity, that thou ſhouldſt have diſquiet all the days of thy life.</hi> As if a man that is in a great croud ſhould complain that other folks touch him. While we are in this world God hath ſo ordered things, that afflictions muſt befal us, and if we will complain and be diſcontented upon every croſs and affliction, we muſt complain and be diſcontent all the days of our lives. Yea, God in juſt judgement will let things fall out on purpoſe to vex thoſe that have vexing ſpirits, and diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hearts, and therefore there is a neceſſity that they ſhould live diſquiet all their days: and men will not much care to diſquiet thoſe that are continually murmuring, Oh they will have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet all their days.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There's this dreadful evil in diſcontent and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God may justly with draw his care of you, and his protection over you, ſeeing God cannot pleaſe you in his adminiſtrations.</hi> We
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:132683:82"/>uſe to ſay ſo to diſcontented ſervants; Nay, if you be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, mend your ſelves when you will, If you have a ſervant not content with his diet, and wages, and work, you ſay, Mend your ſelves. So may God juſtly ſay to us, we that profeſs our ſelves ſervants to him, to be in his work, and yet are diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this thing or that in Gods family, God might juſtly ſay, Mend your ſelves. What if God ſhould ſay to any of you, If my care over you do not pleaſe you, then take care of your ſelves; if my protection over you will not pleaſe you, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect your ſelves: Now all things that do befall you, befall you through a providence of God, and if you be thoſe that belong to God, there is a protection of God over you, and a care of God. Now if God ſhould ſay, Well, you ſhall not have the benefit of my protection any longer, and I will take no further care of you: would not this be a moſt dreadful judgement of God from Heaven upon you? Take heed what you do then in being diſcontent with Gods will towards you, and indeed upon diſcontent this may befall you. And this is the reaſon why many people, though Gods protection hath bin very gracious over them for a time, and they have thriven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, yet afterwards almoſt all that behold them may ſay, that they live as if God had caſt off his care over them, and as if God did not care what befall them. Now then, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, put all theſe together, all that we were ſpeaking of the laſt day, and theſe particulars that have been added now this morning for the ſetting out of a Murmuring and Diſcontented ſpirit; Oh what an ugly face hath this ſin of murmuring, and diſcontentedneſs? Oh what cauſe is there that we ſhould lay our hands upon our hearts, and go away and be humbled before the Lord becauſe of this! Whereas your thoughts were wont to be exerciſed about providing for your ſelves, and getting more comforts to your ſelves, let the ſtream of your thoughts now be turned to humble your ſelves for your diſcontentedneſs, Oh that you may have your hearts break before God, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ſhall fall to it again, Oh the wretchedneſs of mans heart! You will find in Scripture concerning the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> how ſtrangely they fell to their murmuring again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, do but obſerve three texts of Scripture, for that, the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:132683:82"/>firſt in the 15. of <hi>Exod.</hi> at the beginning, there you ſhall have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Congregation ſinging to God, and bleſſing God for his mercy, <hi>Then ſang Moſes and the Children of Iſrael this ſong unto the Lord, and ſpake ſaying, I will ſing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly, the horſe and his rider hath he thrown into the Sea.</hi> And then, <hi>The Lord is my strength and ſong, and he is become my Salvation, he is my God, and I will prepare him an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; my Fathers God, and I will exalt him;</hi> and ſo he goes on, <hi>And who is like unto thee, O Lord amongſt the Gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders?</hi> Thus their hearts triumphed in God: but mark before the Chapter is ended, in the 23. verſe, <hi>When they come to Marah</hi> (in the ſame Chapter) <hi>they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter, therefore the name of it was called Marah, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple murmured againſt Moſes.</hi> After ſo great a mercy as this was, what unthankfulneſs was there here in their murmuring! Then God gave them water, but in the very next Chapter they fell to their murmuring (you read not that they were humbled for their former murmuring, and therefore they murmur again) <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.1. &amp;c. <hi>all the congregation of the Children of Iſrael came to the wilderneſs of Sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the whole Congregation</hi> (in the ſecond verſe) <hi>of the Children of Iſrael murmured againſt Moſes, and againſt Aaron in the wilderneſs, and the Children of Iſrael ſaid unto them, would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the Land of Egypt, when we ſat by the fleſh-pots, and when we did eat bread to the full.</hi> Now they want fleſh (they wanted water before, but now they want meat) they fell to murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they were not humbled for this murmuring againſt God, neither when God gave them fleſh according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, but they fell to murmuring again, they wanted ſomewhat elſe. In the very next Chapter (they went not far) in the 17. of <hi>Exod.</hi> beginning. <hi>And all the Congregation of the Children of Iſrael journyed from the wilderneſs of Sin, and pitched in Repha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim, and there was no water for the people to drink:</hi> Then in the ſecond verſe, <hi>Wherefore the people did chide with Moſes, and ſaid, Give us water that we may drink, and Moſes ſaid unto them, Why chide you with me? wherefore do you tempt the Lord:</hi> And in the third verſe, <hi>And the people thirſted there for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the people murmured againſt Moſes and ſaid, wherefore
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:132683:83"/>is this, that thou haſt brought us up out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>to kill us, and our Children, and our Cattel with thirſt?</hi> So one time after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtill as ſoon as ever they had received the mercy, then they were a little quieted, but they were not humbled. I bring theſe Scriptures for this, to ſhew, That if we have not been humbled for murmuring, the next croſs that we meet withal we will fall to murmuring again,</p>
               <p>There are divers Aggravations of this ſin of Murmuring, I'le mention but one now, and I ſhall but begin that. The firſt Aggravation is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To murmur when we enjoy abundance of mercy, the greater and the more abundant the mercy is that we enjoy, the greater, and the viler is the ſin of murmuring.</hi> As here now when God had newly delivered them out of the houſe of bondage, for them now to murmur becauſe they want ſome few particulars that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Oh to ſin againſt God after a great mercy, this is a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, and a moſt abominable thing. Now my brethren, the Lord hath granted us very great mercies, I'le but ſpeak a word of what God hath done of late, what mercies hath the Lord granted to us this Summer, heaped mercies upon us, one mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon another. What a condition were we in at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Summer? And what a different condition are we in now! Oh what a mercy is it, that the Lord hath not taken advantages againſt us, that he hath not made thoſe Scriptures (before mentioned) good upon us for all our murmuring, the Lord hath gone on with one mercy after another. We hear of mercy in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and mercy to our brethren in <hi>Scotland:</hi> But ſtill if after this we ſhould have any thing befall us that is but croſs to us, that we ſhould be ready to murmur again preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Oh let us not ſo require God for thoſe mercies of his; Oh let us take heed of giving God any ill requital for his mercies; Oh give God praiſe according to his excellent greatneſs, to his excellent goodneſs and grace.</p>
               <p>And now, Hath God given to you the Contentment of your hearts? Take you heed of being the cauſe of any grief to your Brethren, think not that becauſe God hath been gracious unto you, that therefore he hath given you liberty for to bring them
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:132683:83"/>into bondage, Oh let not there be ſuch an ill effect of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to you, as for you to exclude by petitioning, or any other way, your Brethren that the Lord hath been pleaſed to make Iuſtruments of your peace, let not that be the fruit of it, nor to deſire any thing that your ſelves do not yet underſtand. God is very jealous of the glory of his mercy, and if there ſhould be an ill uſe made of the mercy of God after we enjoy it, Oh it would go to the heart of God! nothing is more grievous to the heart of God than the abuſe of mercy: As now, if any way that is hard and rigid ſhould be taken towards our Brethren, and thoſe eſpecially that God hath made ſuch ſpecial inſtruments of good to us, that have been willing to venture their lives, and all for us; now when we have our turns ſerved, let God and his People, and Servants that have been a means to ſave us ſhift for themſelves as well as they can: Oh! this is a great aggravation of your ſin, to ſin againſt the mercies of God: But for this Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, and eſpecially in this particular, we ſhall ſpeak to (God willing) the next day.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:132683:84"/>midst of mercies, in enjoyment of abundance of mercies.</hi> To be diſcontent in any afflicted condition, is ſinful and evil, but to be diſcontent when we are in the midſt of Gods mercies, when we are not able to count the mercies of God, yet after to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent becauſe we have not all we would have, this is a greater evil. I onely mentioned this the laſt day, that I might ſhew to you what a great ſin it is at ſuch a time as this. The Lord this Summer hath multiplied mercies one upon another, the Lord hath made this Summer to be a continual miracle of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; never did a Kingdom enjoy (in ſo little ſpace of time) ſuch mercies one upon another: Now the publick mercies of God ſhould quiet our hearts and keep us from diſcontent; and the ſin of diſcontent; for private afflictions is exceedingly aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the conſideration of publick mercies to the Land: When the Lord hath been ſo merciful to the land, wilt thou be fretting and murmuring, becauſe thou haſt not in thy family all the comforts that thou wouldſt have? As it is a great aggravation of a mans evil, of him, to rejoyce immoderately in his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate comforts when the Church is in affliction, when the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſuffers grievous and hard troubles, if any man ſhall then rejoyce and give liberty to himſelf, at that time to ſatisfie his fleſh to the uttermoſt in all outward comforts, this is a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of his Sin: So on the contrary, for any man to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately troubled for any private affliction, when it goes well with the publick, with the Churches, this is a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of his ſin: It may be when the Church of God was loweſt, and it went worſe in other parts, yet thou didſt abate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the comfort of thy fleſh, but gaveſt full liberty to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy fleſh as formerly, know, this was thy great ſin, ſo on the other ſide, when we have received ſuch mercies in publick, we ſhould have all our private afflictions ſwallowed up in the publick mercies, and we ſhould think with our ſelves, though we be afflicted for our particular, yet (bleſſed be God) it goes well with the Church, and with the publick? the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſhould mightily quiet our hearts in all our private diſcontents, and if it doth not ſo, know that our ſin is much encreaſed by the mercies of God that are abroad. Now ſhall Gods mercies aggravate our ſins? This is a ſad thing, this is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:132683:84"/>to turn the mercies of God to be our miſery. Didſt not thou pray to God for theſe mercies that God hath ſent of late to the publick, theſe great victories that God hath given, didſt not thou pray for them? now thou haſt them, Is not there enough in them to quiet thy heart for ſome private trouble thou meeteſt withall in thy family? Is not there goodneſs enough there to cure thy diſcontentment? Certainly they were not ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſo worthy to be prayed for, except they have ſo much excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in them as to countervail ſome private afflictions. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick mercies are the aggravations of private diſcontent, alſo of publick diſcontent too; if we receive ſo many publick mercies, yet if every thing goes not in the publick according as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, if we be diſcontent at that, it will exceedingly aggravate our ſin, God may ſay, What ſhall I beſtow ſuch mercies upon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and yet if they have not every thing they would have, they will be diſcontent? Oh! its exceeding evil. So in particular, the mercies that concerns thy ſelf, thy family, if thou wouldeſt conſider thou haſt a great many more mercies than thou hadſt afflictions, I dare boldly aver it concerning any one in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation (ſuppoſe thy afflictions to be what they will) there is never a one of you but that have more mercies than afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>I, but you do not know what our afflictions are, our afflictions are ſo as you do not conceive of them, becauſe you feel them not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though I cannot know what your afflictions are, yet I know what your mercies are, and I know they are ſo great, as I am ſure there can be no affliction in this world ſo great as the mercies you have: If it were but this mercy, That you have this day of grace and ſalvation continued to you, its a greater mercy than any affliction, ſet any affliction by this mercy and ſee which would weigh heavieſt, this is certainly greater than any affliction; that you have the day of grace and ſalvation, that you are not now in Hell, this is a greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that you have the ſound of the Goſpel yet in your ears; that you have the uſe of your reaſon; this is a greater mercy than your afflictions; that you have the uſe of your limbs, your ſenſes, that you have the health of your bodies, health
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:132683:85"/>of body is a greater mercy than poverty is an affliction; there is no man that is rich but if he be wiſe, if he hath a ſickly body, he would part with all his riches that he might have his health; therefore thy mercies are more than thy afflictions. We find in Scripture how the holy Ghoſt doth aggravate the ſin of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content from the conſideration of mercies, you have a notable Scripture for it in the 16. of <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. verſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Its a ſpeech of <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Korah</hi> and his company when they murmured, <hi>And Moſes ſaid unto Korah, Hear I pray you, ye ſons of Levi</hi> (there's ſomewhat that you are ſons of <hi>Levy</hi>) <hi>Seemeth it but a ſmall thing unto you, that the God of Iſrael hath ſeparated you from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Iſrael, to bring you neer to himſelf, to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and to ſtand before the Congregation to miniſter unto them? Korah</hi> and his company were murmuring, but mark how <hi>Moſes</hi> aggravates this; Seemeth it a ſmall thing unto you, that the God of Iſrael hath ſeparated you from the Congregation of Iſrael to bring you neer to himſelf to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Lord? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You ſee 'tis a great honor that God puts upon a man, a great mercy that he doth beſtow upon any man, to ſeparate him from others for himſelf, to come neer to him, to imploy him in the ſervice of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, to miniſter to the Congregation in holy things, this is a great mercy, and indeed it's ſuch a mercy, as one would think, there ſhould be none that God beſtows ſuch a mercy upon, that ſhould have a murmuring heart for any affliction, Its true, many Miniſters of God they meet with hard things that might diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, and trouble and grieve their ſpirits, but now this conſideration that God is pleaſed to imploy them in ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice neer to himſelf, that though they cannot do good to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet they may do good to others, this ſhould quiet them: And yet in <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>And he hath brought thee neer to him, and all thy Brethren, the ſons of Levi with thee; and ſeek ye the Prieſt hood alſo?</hi> Have not you enough already? but ſtill you are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with what you have, and muſt have more, ſeck ye yet more? <hi>Seek ye the Prieſthood alſo? for which cauſe both thou and all thy company are gathered together againſt the Lord: And what is. Aaron that ye murmur againſt him?</hi> What, hath God given you ſuch things, and yet will you be murmuring, becauſe you
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:132683:85"/>cannot have more? Methinks that this place ſhould keep Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters from murmuring, though they ſhould meet with never ſuch afflictions and croſſes, and unkind dealings from men, yet ſtill they ſhould go on with hearts quieted and comforted in the work that God hath ſet them about, and labour to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail all their afflictions by being more abundant in the work of the Lord. That is the firſt text of Scripture that ſhews how the mercies we enjoy are Aggravations to the ſin of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.</p>
               <p>And then a ſecond Scripture is in the 2. of <hi>Job, verſ.</hi> 10. A ſpeech of <hi>Job</hi> to his wife, what ſaith <hi>Job</hi> when his wife would have had him curſe God and dye? (that was a degree beyond murmuring) why ſaith he, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſhall we receive good at the hand of God, and not evil?</hi> you ſee <hi>Job</hi> did help himſelf againſt all murmuring thoughts againſt the ways of God with this conſideration, That he had received ſo much good from the Lord; what though we receive evil, yet do not we receive good as well as evil? let us ſet one againſt the other, thats the way we ſhould go. In the 17. of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> the 14. <hi>verſe,</hi> you have a notable Scripture there whereby you may ſee what courſe is to be taken when the heart riſes in murmuring <hi>In the day of proſperity be joyful, but in the day of Adverſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</hi> what ſhould they conſider? (mark what follows) <hi>God alſo hath ſet the one over againſt the other, to the end that man ſhould find nothing after him.</hi> God alſo hath ſet the one over againſt the other, thats thus, When thou art in proſperity, then indeed every man can be joyful; but what if afflictions befalls him, what then? then conſider: Conſider what? That God hath ſet one over againſt the other, thou haſt a great deal of affliction, and thou haſt had a great deal of proſperity, thou haſt many troubles, and thou haſt had many mercies, make one column of mercies, and one column of afflictions, and write one againſt the other, and ſee if God hath not fil'd one column as full as the other; you look altogether upon your afflictions, but look upon your mercies alſo; for inſtance, It may be God hath afflicted you in one childe, but he hath been merciful to you in another childe, ſet one againſt the other; God afflicted <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Abſalom,</hi> but he was merciful to <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:132683:86"/>in <hi>Solomon,</hi> and therefore when <hi>David</hi> cryed our, Oh <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom my Son, my Son!</hi> If <hi>David</hi> had thought upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> and cryed, Oh <hi>Solomon</hi> my ſon, my ſon, it would have quieted him. And it may be God hath been merciful to thee in a Wife, or in thy Husband, ſet that againſt thy affliction, it may be God croſſes thee in thy Eſtate, but it may be he doth imploy thee in his Service, it may be thou art afflicted in ſome of thy Friends, but thou haſt other Friends that are great mercies to thee, and therefore you ſhould ſet one againſt the other, and it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you ſo to do, for thoſe mercies will be aggravations of your ſins, and you had better make Gods mercies a means to leſſen your ſins than to be the aggravation of your ſins: If you make not the mercies of God to help you againſt your mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, you will make them to be aggravations of the ſin of murmuring. I beſeech you for this take but this one conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration further, and if you will but work it upon your hearts, I hope you may find a great deal of power in it. You find af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and your hearts are troubled and murmur, conſider how Gods mercies do aggravate this ſin, thus: In the midſt of our ſins we do make account God ſhould accept of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, do but conſider thus, If in the midſt of our many ſins we hope that God will accept of our poor ſervices, why then ſhould not we in the midſt of our afflictions bleſs God for his many mercies? Shall God be thus gracious to us that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our many ſins, yet he will not caſt away our poor duties and ſervices that we perform, then why ſhould not we in the midſt of our ſufferings accept of what mercies we have, and not ſleight them and diſregard them? If thou in the midſt of Gods mercies ſhall not be willing to bear afflictions that God laies upon thee, then it were juſt with God that in the midſt of thy ſins he ſhould not regard any of thy duties; now is there not as much power in thy manifold ſins to cauſe God to reject thy duties and ſervices, as there is power in afflictions (in the midſt of many mercies) to take off thy heart from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected with Gods mercies? And that's the firſt aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſin of murmuring, To murmur in the midſt of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is, <hi>When we
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:132683:86"/>murmur for ſmall things.</hi> Saith <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervant to him, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for ſo he called him) if the Prophet had required you to do ſome great thing, would not you have done it? how much more this little thing. So I ſay, if the Lord had required you to ſuffer ſome great matter, would not you have been willing to ſuffer? How much more this little thing. I remember I have read in <hi>Seneca</hi> a Heathen, he hath this ſimilitude which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine one to ſet out the great evil of murmuring upon ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler afflictions (ſaith he) Suppoſe a man hath a very fair houſe to dwell in, and he hath fair Orchards and Gardens, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with brave tall Trees for ornament, if this man now ſhould murmur becauſe the wind blows off a few leaves off his Trees, what a moſt unreaſonable thing were it for him to be weeping and wringing his hands becauſe he loſes a few leaves off his Trees, when he hath abundance of all kind of fruit? Thus it is with many (ſaith he) though they have a great many comforts about them, yet ſome little matter, the blowing off of a few leaves from them is enough to diſquiet them. It was a great evil when <hi>Ahab</hi> having a Kingdom, yet the want of his neighbors Vineyard had ſuch power to diſquiet him: So for us to murmur, not becauſe we have not ſuch a thing as we have, need of, but becauſe we have not what poſſibly we might have this is a very great ſin. Suppoſe God gives a childe that hath all the Limbs and parts compleat, a Childe that is very come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hath excellent parts, wit, and memory, but it may be there is a wart that grows upon the finger of the childe, and ſhe murmurs at it, and Oh, what an affliction is this to her! ſhe is ſo taken up with that, as ſhe forgets to give any thanks to God for her Childe, and all the goodneſs of God to her in the Childe is ſwallowed up in that; would not you ſay, this were a folly and a great evil in a woman ſo to do? Truely our afflictions if we weighed them aright they are but ſuch kind of things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of our mercies. <hi>Rebeckah</hi> ſhe had a mighty deſire to have children, but becauſe ſhe found ſome trouble in her body when ſhe was with childe, ſaith ſhe, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> As if ſhe ſhould ſay, I had as good have none, onely becauſe ſhe found a little pain and trouble in her body. To be diſcontent when the affliction is ſmall and little, that encreaſes very much the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:132683:87"/>ſin of murmuring, it is too much for any one to murmur upon the heavieſt croſs that can befal one in this world, but upon ſome ſmall things to be diſcontent and murmur, thats worſe. I have read of one that when he lay upon a heap of Damas Roſes, he complained, there was one of the Roſe leaves lay double un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: So we are ready thus for very ſmall things to make complaints and be diſcontented with our condition. And thats the ſecond Aggravation.</p>
               <p>A third Aggravation is this, <hi>For men that are of parts and abilities, to whom God hath given wiſdom, for them to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and murmur, thats more than if others do it.</hi> Murmuring and diſcontentedneſs is too much in the weakeſt, yet we can bear with it ſometimes in Children and Women that are weak; but for thoſe that are Men, Men of underſtanding, that have wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that God imploys in publick ſervice, that they ſhould be diſcontent with every thing, this is an exceeding great evil; for men in their families (to whom God hath given parts and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) when things fall out amiſs there, to be always murmuring and repining, their ſin is greater than for women and children to do it.</p>
               <p>A Fourth aggravation is, <hi>The conſideration of the freeneſs of all Gods Mercies to us.</hi> What ever we have it is of free-coſt, what though we have not all we would have, ſeeing what we have is free? If what we have were earned, then it were ſomewhat, but when we conſider that all is from God, for us to murmur at his diſpenſations, is very evil. Suppoſe a man were in a family en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by a friend, and he did not pay for his board, but he hath it given him for nothing, its expected ſuch a one ſhould not be ready to find fault with every thing in the houſe, with ſervants or with meat at table, or the like, if ſuch a one that hath plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proviſion, and all given him gratis, and pays nothing for his diet, ſhould be diſcontented, if a Cup ſhould not be filled for him as he would have it, or if he ſhould ſtay a minute of an hour longer for a thing than he would, this we would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a great evil: So it is with us, we are at Gods Table every day, and it is upon free coſt whatever we have. It is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very unmannerly for a man at his friends table to find fault with things, though at home he may be bold: Now when we
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:132683:87"/>are at the table of God (for ſo all Gods adminiſtrations to us are his table) and are at free-coſt, now for us to be finding fault, and be diſcontented, this is a great Aggravation of our ſin.</p>
               <p>A Fifth Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>When men and women murmur, and are diſcontented and impatient, when they have the things that they were diſcontented for the want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had them.</hi> So it is ſometimes with children, they will cry for ſuch a thing, and when you give it them, they throw it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they are as much diſcontented as they were before. So it was with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nothing would quiet them, but they muſt have a King, <hi>Samuel</hi> perſwaded them to the contrary, and told them what kind of King they ſhould have; and when they had a King, in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.3. <hi>What ſhall a King do to us?</hi> they were not contented when they had one. So <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſhe muſt have children or elſe ſhe died, and when ſhe had a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe was diſcontented too; ſo that we are neither well full nor faſting (as we uſe to ſay.)</p>
               <p>The ſixth aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>For thoſe men and women to be diſcontent and murmur that God hath raiſed from mean and low eſtates and conditions:</hi> This is a very great aggravation if thou be diſcontent now: There was a time when thou wert low enough; and perhaps when thou wert ſo low then thou did'ſt ſay, O if God would deliver me from ſuch an affliction, or give me but a little more in my eſtate, I ſhould think my ſelf in a good condition: but if God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth raiſe thee, thou art as greedy of more ſtill as thou wert before, and as much diſcontented as thou wert before: this is an evil thing for people that had mean breeding, and poor beginning for them to be ſo nice, and dainty that nothing can pleaſe them, whereas there was a time not long ſince that they were low and mean enough; But it is very ordinary for thoſe that are raiſed from a low and mean condition to be the more nice and dainty, and more proud when they are raiſed than others that are of better breeding. Its too much for a childe to be diſcontented in his fathers houſe, but if a man hath taken a poor begger boy, if you had taken ſuch a one into your houſe that lay begging at your door, and ſet him at your own table,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:132683:88"/>could you bear that ſuch a one ſhould complain that ſuch a thing is not well dreſt, or the like; you could not bear it if your children ſhould do it, but you could bear it a great deal better with them than to hear ſuch a one do it: but thou art a poor beggar, and God hath (as it were) taken thee into his great Family, and if the Lord hath been pleaſed to raiſe thee higher, that now thou haſt a competency, that thou mayeſt live as a man, to be of uſe and ſervice in the place where God hath ſet thee, now wilt thou be diſcontent becauſe thou haſt not every thing that thou deſireſt? we know the Prodigal, when he came to imſelf, Oh! ſaith he, <hi>In my fathers houſe is bread enough,</hi> He did not ſay there's good chear enough, and a great deal of dainties; no, he thought of nothing but bread, <hi>there's bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;</hi> So its ordinary for men and women when they are in a low condition, they think that if they may have bread, any competency, they will be contented and bleſs God, but when they have their bread and things convenient, they muſt have more or elſe they are not contented; know that this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great aggravation to thy diſcontentment, when you are raiſed from a very low condition, and yet you cannot be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with what you have.</p>
               <p>A ſeventh aggravation of this ſin is this, <hi>For them to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that have been very great ſinners and ungodly in their former time.</hi> For men and women that have much guiltineſs upon them, the guilt of very many ſins upon them, that have provok'd God exceedingly againſt them, and have brought themſelves in a moſt dreadful manner under the ſentence of Gods Juſtice, and yet God being pleaſed to reprieve them, for them to murmur and to be diſcontent with Gods adminiſtrations towards them, this is exceeding evil, Oh it were conſideration enough to quiet any murmuring in our hearts, to think thus, We are but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, why ſhould not we be ſufferers that are ſinners? But then conſider, we that are ſuch great ſinners, guilty of ſuch notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſins, that it is a wonder that we are out of Hell at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet for us to be diſcontent and murmur, how exceedingly doth this encreaſe our ſins! Conſider how we have croſſed God in our ſins, then if God ſhould croſs us in the way of our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſhould not we ſit down quiet without murmuring
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:132683:88"/>Certainly thou never kneweſt what it was to be humbled for thy manifold ſins, that art diſcontented at any adminiſtration of God towards thee.</p>
               <p>The Eight Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is, <hi>For thoſe men that are of little uſe in the world, for them to be diſcontented.</hi> If you have but a beaſt that you make much uſe of, you will feed it well, but if you have but little uſe of him, then you turn him into the Commons, little proviſion ſerves his turn, becauſe you make not uſe of him: If we liv'd ſo as to be exceeding uſeful to God and his Church, we might expect that God would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come in, in ſome encouraging way to us, but when our conſciences tell us, we live and do but little ſervice for God, what if God ſhould turn us upon the Commons, yet we are fed according to our work, according to our imployment; Why ſhould any creature be ſerviceable to thee, who art ſo little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to God? This one meditation would much help us, to think, I am diſcontent, becauſe ſuch and ſuch Creatures are not ſerviceable to me, but why ſhould I expect that they ſhould be ſerviceable to me, when I am not ſerviceable to God? And that's the Eight Aggravation.</p>
               <p>A Ninth Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>For us to be diſcontent at that time when God is to humble us.</hi> It ſhould be the care of a Chriſtian, to obſerve what are Gods ways to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, what is God about to do with me at this time? Is God about to raiſe me, to comfort me? Let me cloſe with Gods goodneſs, and bleſs his Name, let me joyn with the work of God, when he offers mercy to me, to take the mercy he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. But again, Is God about to humble me? Is God about to break my heart, and to bring my heart down to him? Let me joyn with God in this work of his, this is for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to walk with God. It is ſaid that <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God; walked with God, what's that? That is, To obſerve what is the work of God that God is now about, and to joyn with God in that work of his; ſo that according as God turns this way or that way, the heart ſhould turn with God, and have ſuitable workings unto the workings of God towards him. Now then, I am diſcontented, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, becauſe I am afflicted; Therefore thou art afflicted,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:132683:89"/>becauſe God would humble thee, and the great deſign that God hath in afflicting of thee, is, To break and humble thy heart; And wilt thou now maintain a ſpirit quite oppoſite to the Work of God? for thee to murmure and be diſcontented, is to reſiſt the Work of God; God is doing thee good, if thou couldeſt ſee it, now if he be pleaſed to ſanctifie thy affliction, to break that hard heart of thine, and humble that proud ſpirit of thine, it would be the greateſt mercy that ever thou hadſt in all thy life; Now wilt thou yet ſtand out againſt God? Its even as if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Well, the Lord is about to break me, and humble me, but he ſhall not; this is the language of thy mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and thy diſcontentedneſs, though thou dareſt not ſay ſo, but though thou ſayeſt not ſo in words, yet it is certainly the language of the temper of thy ſpirit: Oh! conſider what an aggravation this is? I am diſcontented when God is about to work ſuch a work upon me as is exceedingly for my good, but yet I ſtand out againſt him and reſiſt him. That's the Ninth Aggravation.</p>
               <p>The tenth Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is this, <hi>The more palpable and remarkable the hand of God appears to bring about an affliction, the greater is the ſin of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and diſcontent under an affliction.</hi> It's a great evil at any time to murmure and be diſcontent, but though it be a ſin, when I ſee but an ordinary providence working for me, not to ſubmit to that, but when I ſee an extraordinary providence working, that's a greater ſin! that is, when I ſee the Lord in ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way working about ſuch an affliction, beyond what any could have thought of, ſhall I reſiſt ſuch a remarkable hand of God? ſhall I ſtand out againſt God when I ſee God expreſs his will in ſuch a remarkable manner that he would have me to be in ſuch a condition? Indeed before we ſee the Will of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, we may deſire to avoid an affliction and may uſe means for it, but now, when we ſee God expreſſing his Will from Heaven in a manner beyond ordinary, and more remarkable, then certainly it is fit for us to fall down and ſubmit to him, and not to oppoſe; when God comes with a mighty ſtream againſt us, it's our beſt way to fall down before him and not to reſiſt; for as 'tis an argument of a mans diſobedience, when there is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:132683:89"/>not only a Command againſt a ſin, but when God reveals his Command in a terrible way; the more ſolemn the Command of God is, the greater is the ſin in breaking that Command: ſo the more remarkable the hand of God is in bringing an affliction upon us, the greater is the ſin for us to murmure and be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. Then God expects that we ſhould fall down when he (as it were) ſpeaks from Heaven to thee by name, and ſaith, Well, I will have this ſpirit of thine down, do not you ſee that my hand is ſtretched out, my eyes are upon you, my thoughts are upon you, and I muſt have that proud ſpirit of thine down? Oh then it's fit for the creature to yield and ſubmit unto him. When you ſpeak in an ordinary manner to your ſervants, or Children, you expect they ſhould regard what you ſay, but when you make them ſtand ſtill by you and you ſpeak to them in a more ſolemn way, then if they ſhould diſregard what you ſay, you are very impatient: So certainly God cannot take it well when ever he doth appear from Heaven in ſuch a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way to bring an affliction, if then we do not ſubmit to him.</p>
               <p>The Eleventh Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>To be diſcontented though God hath been exerciſing of us long under afflictions, yet ſtill to remain diſcontented.</hi> For a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at firſt when an affliction befals them to have a murmuring heart, then it's an evil; but to have a murmuring heart when God hath been a long time exerciſing them with afflictions, it's more evil, Though an Heifer at firſt when the yoke is put upon him, he wriggles up and down and will not be quiet, but if after many moneths or years it ſhall not draw quietly, the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would rather feed, and fat, and prepare it for the Butcher, than be troubled any longer with it: So though the Lord was content to paſs by that diſcontented ſpirit of thine at firſt, yet God having a long time kept the yoke upon thee, thou haſt been under his afflicting hand (it may be) divers years; and yet thou remain diſcontent ſtill; it were juſt with God that he ſhould bear thy murmuring no longer, and that thy diſcontent under the affliction ſhould be but a preparation to thy deſtruction. So you ſee when a man or woman hath been long exerciſed with afflictions, and yet are diſcontented, that's an aggravation of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:132683:90"/>ſin: Mark that text in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>No chaſtening for the preſent is joyous, but grievous; nevertheleſs, afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs, unto them which are exerciſed thereby.</hi> It's true, our afflictions are not joyous but grievous; though at firſt when our affliction comes it is very grievous, but yet (ſaith the text) <hi>afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs to thoſe that are exerciſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:</hi> When thou haſt been a long time in the School of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thou art a very Dullard in Chriſts School if thou haſt not learned this Contentment, <hi>I have learned</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>in every ſtate therewith to be content: Paul</hi> had learned this leſſon quickly, thou haſt been a learning many years, perhaps thou mayſt ſay as <hi>Heman</hi> did, <hi>That thou art afflicted from thy youth up,</hi> in 88. <hi>Pſal.</hi> Oh its a very evil thing, if being exerciſed long with afflictions you are not yet contented. The eye is as tender a part as any is in a mans body, but yet the eye is able to continue in, and bear a great deal of cold, becauſe it is more uſed to it; ſo thoſe that are uſed to afflictions, thoſe that God exerciſes much with afflictions (though they have tender ſpirits otherwiſe) yet they ſhould have learned Contentedneſs by this time. A new Cart may creek and make a noiſe, but after the uſe of it a while it will not do ſo: So when thou wert firſt a Chriſtian, and newly come into the work of Chriſt, perhaps thou madeſt a noiſe, and couldſt not bear affliction; but art thou an old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and yet wilt thou be a murmuring Chriſtian? Oh that's a ſhame for any that are ancient profeſſors, that have been a long time in the School of Jeſus Chriſt, to have murmuring and diſcontented ſpirits. And thus you have had Eleven Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this ſin of murmuring and diſcontentment.</p>
               <p>But now my Brethren, becauſe this diſcontented humour is a very tough humour, and it is very hard to work upon; there's none that are diſcontented, but will have ſomething to ſay for their diſcontent: I ſhall therefore deſire to take away what every diſcontented heart hath to ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place, <hi>Saith one that is diſcontented, It is not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, it is the ſenſe of my condition, I hope you would have me ſenſible of my condition: perhaps when God takes away a friend, or ſome other comfort, they are inordinately ſorrowful, and wringing their hands as if they were undone, and let any one but ſpeak to them,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Would you not have me ſenſible of my affliction? And thus many would hide their ſinful murmuring under Gods hand with this pretence, that it is but ſenſibleneſs of their affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, Firſt, There is no ſenſe of any affliction that will hinder the ſenſe of Gods Mercies, nay the more we are ſenſible of our afflictions, if it be in a gracious manner, the more ſenſible we will be of Gods mercy; but thou art ſo ſenſible of thy affliction, as it takes away the ſenſe of all thy mercies; Oh this is ſinful diſcontent, this is not to be ſenſible of thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as God would have thee, but it is to be ſenſible in a wicked way, you go beyond your bounds: By this rule you may come to know when your ſorrows and troubles for your afflictions go beyond the bounds; we may be ſorrowful when God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, but Oh! that I might know when my ſorrow goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of it; truly thou mayeſt know it by this, Doth the ſenſe of thy afflictions take away the ſenſe of thy mercies? If it doth, then it goes beyond the bounds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it were but a bare ſenſe of an affliction, it would not hinder thee in the duties of thy condition, the right ſenſe of our afflictions will never hinder us in the performance of the duties of our condition, but thou art ſo ſenſible of thy affliction, as thou art made unfit for the performance of any duties of the condition that God hath put thee in, ſurely it's more than meer ſenſe of thy affliction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If it were but meer ſenſe of thy affliction, yet then thou couldeſt in this thy condition bleſs God for the mercies that others have, but thy diſcontentedneſs uſually breeds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy at it; when any one is diſcontented with their condition, they have an envious ſpirit at the conditions of thoſe that are delivered from what afflictions they bear, certainly then it's
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:132683:91"/>turn'd to be ſowre and naught, when thou art ſo ſenſible of thy afflictions, and unſenſible of mercies as thou art unfit for the duties of thy condition, and envious at others that are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted as thou art.</p>

                  <p>But will a diſcontented heart ſay, <hi>I am not ſo much troubled with my afflictions, but it is for my ſin rather than my affliction, and I hope you will give leave that we ſhould be troubled and diſcontented with our ſin; and were it not for ſin that I ſee in my ſelf, I ſhould not be ſo diſcontented as I am, Oh! it's ſin that is heavy upon me, and it's that that troubles me more than my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deceive not thy own heart, there is a very great deceit in this, there's many people that when Gods hand is out againſt them, they will ſay, they are troubled for their ſin, but the truth is, it's the affliction that doth trouble them rather than their ſin, their heart doth exceedingly deceive them in this very thing: For,
<list>
                        <item>Firſt, They were never troubled for their ſin before this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction came; but you will ſay, <hi>It's true, I was not before, for my proſperity blinded me, but now God hath opened my eyes by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> Hath he ſo?</item>
                        <item>Secondly, Then thy great care will be rather for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thy ſin, than of thy affliction; Art thou more ſolicitous about the taking away thy ſin, than the taking away of thine affliction?</item>
                        <item>Thirdly, If it be thy ſin that troubles thee, If God ſhould take away thy afflictions, yet except thy ſin be taken away, and thy heart be better, this would not content thee, thou couldeſt not be ſatisfied: but we ſee it ordinarily, that if God removes their afflictions, there's no more trouble for their ſin. Oh, many do be-lye themſelves in this, in ſaying, that they are ſo troubled for their ſin, and eſpecially thoſe that are ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that they are in danger to miſcarry, and to make away themſelves, there's not one in ten thouſand that are in ſuch a condition as this is, but it is afflictions rather than ſin that puts them to it; indeed you lay all upon this, as if it were the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:132683:91"/>work of the Word, or the Spirit of bondage; I remember I heard not long ſince of a Divine that being judicious, and uſed to ſuch kind of things, there came a man to him mightily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for his ſin, and he could not tell what to do, he was ready to deſpair; the Divine looks upon him, ſaith he, Are you not in debt? he confeſt that he was; and at length the Miniſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to find it out, that that was his trouble rather than his ſin, and ſo was a means to help him that way, that his Creditors ſhould not come upon him, and then the man was pretty quiet, and would not make away himſelf any longer: For it is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual thing, that if any thing befals a man that doth croſs him, Oh then it's their ſin that doth trouble them. Sometimes it is thus with ſervants, if their Governors croſs them, then they are vext and fret, and come to deal with them, Oh then they will ſay they are ſorrowful for their ſin: but we muſt take heed of dallying with God, that is the Seer and Searcher of the ſecrets of all hearts, many of you go ſullen and dumpiſh up and down your families, and then you ſay its your ſin that lies upon you, when God knows it is otherwiſe, it's becauſe you cannot have your wills as you would have.</item>
                        <item>Fourthly, If thou beeſt troubled for thy ſin, then it will be thy great care not to ſin in thy trouble, not by thy trouble to encreaſe thy ſin, but thou art troubled in ſuch a way as the truth is thou doeſt encreaſe thy ſin in thy trouble, and ſince thou ſayeſt thou wert troubled for thy ſin, thou haſt committed more ſin than thou didſt before.</item>
                        <item>And then laſtly, If it be thy ſin that troubles thee, then thou haſt the more need to ſubmit to Gods hand; <hi>and accept of the puniſhment of thine iniquity,</hi> as it is in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41.

                  <p>
                     <hi>O ſaith another, I find my affliction is ſuch, that God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws himſelf from me in mine affliction, that is that that troubles me, and can any body be quiet then? Can any body be ſatisfied with ſuch a condition when the Lord ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:132683:92"/>himſelf? Were my affliction never ſo great, yet if I find not God withdrawing himſelf from me, I hope I could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with any affliction, but I cannot find the preſence of God with me in this affliction, as ſometimes I have found, and it is that that troubles me, and makes me to be in ſuch a condition as I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to that I anſwer thus, Firſt, it is a very evil thing for men and women upon their affliction to conclude that God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them, it may be when it comes to be examined, there is no other reaſon why thou thinkeſt that God is withdrawn and departed, but becauſe he doth afflict thee; now for thee to make ſuch a concluſion, that every time God lays an affliction upon thee he is departed, this is a ſinful diſtemper of thy heart, and is very diſhonorable to God, and grievous to his Spirit. In the 17. of <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. verſ. you may ſee how God was diſpleaſed there with ſuch a kind of diſtemper as this is, <hi>And he called the name of the place</hi> Maſſah <hi>and</hi> Meribah, <hi>becauſe of the chiding of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, and becauſe they tempted the Lord, ſaying, Is the Lord amongſt us, or not?</hi> Mark, they did murmure, becauſe they were brought into afflictions, but ſee what the text ſaith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the place was called <hi>Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> becauſe they temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Is the Lord amongſt us, or not?</hi> This was to tempt God. Sometimes we are afraid God is departed from us, and it is meerly becauſe we are afflicted. I beſeech you obſerve that Scripture, God calls it a tempting of him, when he afflicts any, for them to conclude and ſay, that God is departed from them. If a Childe ſhould cry out of his Father, and ſay, that his father is turned to be an enemy to him, becauſe he doth correct him, this would be taken ill. I beſeech you conſider of this one place, it may be of very great uſe to you, that you may not be ready to think that God is departed, becauſe you are afflicted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God be departed, the greateſt ſign of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting is, becauſe you are ſo diſquiet, you make your diſquiet to be the fruit of Gods departing, and if it comes to be examined your diſquiet is the cauſe of Gods departing from you, if you could but cure your diſquiet, if you could but quiet your own hearts, and get them into a better frame of contentedneſs under Gods hand in afflicting of you, then you would find Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:132683:92"/>with you, Will you be thus diſquiet till God comes again to you? your diſquiet drives him from you, and you can never expect Gods coming to manifeſt himſelf comfortably to your ſouls, till you have gotten your hearts quiet under your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and therefore here you ſee how croſly you reaſon; you reaſon, I am diſquiet becauſe God is gone, when the truth is, God is gone becauſe thou art diſquiet; reaſon but the other way, Oh my diſquiet hath driven God from me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ever I would have the preſence of God to come again to me, let my heart be quiet under the hand of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Doeſt thou find God departing from thee in thine affliction? Wilt thou therefore depart from God too? Is this thy help? Canſt thou help thy ſelf that way? Becauſe God is gone wilt thou go too? Do I indeed feel God departing from me? It may be it is ſo, it may be God for thy tryal is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted a little from thee, and is it ſo indeed? What unwiſe courſe do I take? I commit further ſin, and ſo I go further off from God, what a caſe am I in? God goes from me, and I from God: if the childe ſees the mother going from it, it's not for the childe to ſay, my mother is gone yonder, and I will go the other way; no, but the childe goes crying after the Mother, and ſo ſhould the ſoul ſay, I ſee the Lord is withdrawing his preſence from me, and now it is beſt for me to make after the Lord with all my might; and I am ſure this murmuring humor is not a making after God, but by this I go further and further off from God, and what a diſtance is there like to be between God and me within a little while? Theſe are ſome of the <hi>Reaſonings</hi> and <hi>Pleas</hi> of a murmuring and diſcontented heart. There are many others that we ſhall meet withall, and endeavour to ſpeak to your hearts in them, that ſo this tough humor of diſcontent may (as it were) be cut with the Word, and ſoftened with the Word, that ſo it may paſs away: for that's the way of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians when they meet with a body that hath any tough humor, then they give that that hath a piercing quality; when there is a tough humor that ſtops the water that it cannot paſs, they give that that hath a piercing quality that may make paſſage for it; and ſo thou haſt need of ſuch things that are piercing to make way through this tough humor that is in the ſpirits of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:132683:93"/>men and women whereby they come to live very uncomfortably to themſelves and others, and very diſhonourably unto God.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, If this be your trouble that men do ſo wrong you, you are rather to turn your hearts to pity them, than to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure or be diſcontented; for the truth is, if you be wronged by other men, you have the better of it, <hi>For it is better to bear wrong, than to do wrong a great deal;</hi> If they wrong you, if your heart can ſubmit, you are in a better condition than they, becauſe it's better to ſuffer, than do wrong.

                  <p>For Anſwer to this, Firſt, It is thy weakneſs and folly that thou didſt not look for it, and expect it: In <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22, 23. ſee what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith concerning himſelf, <hi>And now behold, I go bound in the ſpirit to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there, ſave that the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every City, ſaying, That bonds and afflictions abide me.</hi> It's true, ſaith he, I know not the particular affliction that may befal me, but this I know, that the Spirit of God witneſſeth, <hi>That bonds and afflictions</hi>

                  <p>A ſecond anſwer I ſhall give is this, Is it unexpected? then the leſs proviſion thou madeſt for it before it came, the more careful ſhouldeſt thou be to ſanctifie Gods Name in it now it is come: It is in this caſe of afflictions as in mercies, many times mercy comes unexpected (and that might be a third Anſwer) to you, ſet one againſt the other, I have many mercies that I never lookt for, as well as afflictions that I never lookt for, why ſhould not one rejoyce me as well as the other diſturb me? As it is in mercies, when they come unexpected, the leſs preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there was in me for receiving mercy, the more need I have to be carefull, now to give God the glory of the mercy, and to ſanctifie Gods Name in the enjoyment of the mercy; Oh ſo it ſhould be with us now, we have had mercies this Summer, that we never expected, and therefore we were not prepared for them, now we ſhould be ſo much the more careful to give God the glory of them: ſo when afflictions come that we did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, then it ſeems we laid not in for them before-hand, we had need be the more careful to ſanctifie Gods Name in them, we ſhould have ſpent ſome pains before to prepare for afflictions, and we did not, then take ſo much the more pains to ſanctifie God in this affliction now.

If a Patient comes to take Phyſick, and finds himſelf ſick by it, ſhall he ſay, Oh! if it were any other potion I could bear it, it may be if it were any other than it is, it would not fit thy diſeaſe; yea, if it did not work as it doth, it would not fit thy diſeaſe: ſo when thou ſayeſt of an affliction, if it were any other than it is thou couldeſt bear it; do but anſwer thy ſelf with this, it may be if it were any other than it is, it would not be fit for me, it would not be right to that ſinful humour that there is in my ſoul, and therefore God ſees this to be the fitteſt and the moſt ſuitable for me.</item>

                     <hi>Oh! but the condition that God hath put me in, makes me to be unſerviceable, and this troubles me; it's true, if it were only an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and trouble to my ſelf it were not ſo much, but I am put into ſuch a condition by this affliction, as I am unſerviceable, and am like to do God no further ſervice, God puts me into a mean eſtate, and what good can I do? and how burdenſome is my life to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I can do no ſervice for God! and this is grievous to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed if it be true, that this is thy great grief, it is a good ſign, If thou canſt ſay as in the preſence of God, above all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here in this world to be laid aſide, and not to be imployed in the ſervice of God, I account that the greateſt affliction: I had rather bear any trouble in the world ſo I might do more ſervice, than to be freed from trouble, and to be laid aſide and do little ſervice; canſt thou ſay ſo? It is a good ſign of grace for a man to account afflictions to be great, becauſe he can do the Lord but little ſervice. Few men account that any affliction at all.</p>
                  <p>But yet there may be a temptation in this. To murmure at Gods diſpoſe when your Calling is low and mean, and you can do little ſervice; this is many times a temptation to thoſe that are poor, thoſe that are ſervants, and thoſe that are of weak parts, and are fain to work hard to provide bread for their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; it's many times a grievous burden to them to think, ſuch men the Lord uſes in publick ſervice, and I live in an obſcure way, and to what purpoſe is my life?</p>

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:132683:96"/>
Firſt, To help againſt this temptation that thou mayeſt not murmure againſt this condition, Do but conſider, though thy condition be low and mean, yet thou art in the body, thou art a member of the body though thou beeſt but a mean mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Toe, and the Finger hath its uſe in the body, though it be not the Eye, though it be not the Head, or the Heart, yet it hath its uſe in the body. And it is an excellent expreſſion that I remember <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath about this, (ſaith he) it is better to be the meaneſt member in the body, than to be the higheſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and more excellent and cut off from the body, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a little ſprig in the Tree joyned to the Root, than to be an Arm cut off from the Root. Now other men that have but common gifts in the world, that are not members of Jeſus Chriſt, (indeed) they ſeem to have more excellency than thoſe that are godly, that are in a mean condition, mean parts, mean callings, but they are not of the body, they are not joyned to the Root, and therefore their condition is worſe. As a great Arm of a Tree when it is cut off it hath a great many leaves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and it ſeems a great deal more glorious than thoſe little ſprigs that are upon the Tree, but that little Sprig is in a better condition, why? Becauſe joyned to the Tree, and hath ſap from the root and flouriſheth, but the other will wither and die within a while: So it is with all the men of the world, they be but like great Boughs cut off from the Tree, though they have excellent parts, and have great eſtates, and pomp, and glory in the world, they have no union with Jeſus Chriſt the Root: But now others that live in a poor condition, a poor Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a poor ſervant, a poor labouring man that labours for his family every day, yet he being godly, (ſaith he) though I have but little for the preſent, little glory, little credit, little comfort, yet I am joyned to the body, and there I have ſupply, and that that will feed me with comfort, bleſſing, and mercy to all eternity: So all that are in a poor condition in this world, if they be godly, do but think of that; though thou beeſt mean, yet thou art in the body and joyned to the Root, thou art joyned to the principle of comfort, good, bleſſing, and mercy that will hold out to Eternity, when thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of glorious pompous men in the world ſhall wither and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:132683:96"/>periſh everlaſtingly, and therefore be not troubled at thy mean condition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Though thou haſt but a mean calling in this world, and ſo art not regarded as a man of uſe in the world, yet if thou beeſt a Chriſtian, God hath called thee to a higher calling; thy general calling it is a high calling, though thy particular calling be but low and mean: And for that you have a place in the Chapter before my text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mark</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for the price of the High calling of God in Christ Jeſus:</hi> So that every Chriſtian hath an high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, God hath called him to the higheſt thing that he hath called any creature to that he hath made, the Angels in Heaven have not a higher calling than thou haſt. Thou that perhaps ſpendeſt thy time in a poor buſineſs, in the meaneſt calling, if thou beeſt a dung-raker, to rake channels, or to cleanſe places of filth, or any other thing in the world, that is the meaneſt that can be conceived of, thy general calling as a Chriſtian doth advance thee higher than any particular calling can advance any man in the world; others indeed that are called to mannage the Affairs of the State, they are in a high Calling, or Miniſters they are in a high Calling, but thine in ſome reſpect is higher. A poor ſervant that muſt be ſcraping all day about poor, mean things, many times may have ſuch a temptation as this is, Oh what a poor condition hath God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me to? Will God have regard to ſuch a one that is in ſuch a poor low place as I am? Oh yes, Chriſt hath regard to the meaneſt member; as a man hath as true regard to the Toe if it be in pain, and will tender that as truly and verily as any other member; ſo Chriſt hath regard to his loweſt and meaneſt ones.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thou art in a high calling, though thy outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be low in reſpect of men, yet in reſpect of God thou art in the ſame calling with the Angels in Heaven, and in ſome degree called to that that is higher, for the Scripture ſaith, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels come to underſtand the Myſtery of the Goſpel by the Church; thou that art a Chriſtian in that general calling of thine, thou art joyned with Principalities and Powers, and with Angels, in the greateſt work that God hath called any
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:132683:97"/>creature to, and therefore let that comfort thee in this.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thy calling is low and mean, yet be not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that, for thou haſt a principle within thee (if thou beeſt a godly man or woman) of Grace that doth raiſe thy loweſt actions to be higher in Gods eſteem, than all the brave glorious actions that are done in the world; the principle of Faith doth it, for any man or woman to go on in obedience to God in a way of Faith, in the calling that God hath ſet them, (I ſay doing this through a principle of Faith) it doth raiſe this action, and make it a more glorious action than all the glorious victories of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> than all their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and glorious pomp that they had in all their Conqueſts, it was not ſo glorious as for thee to do the loweſt action out of Faith. Or, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks of a poor Milk-Maid, and yet being a believer, and doth it in faith, he compares that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the glorious actions of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and makes that a great deal more eminent and glorious in the eyes of God, therefore faith raiſes thy works that are but mean, raiſes them to be very glorious.</p>
                  <p>Yea, And the truth is, There is more obedience to ſubmit to God in a low calling, than to ſubmit to him in a higher call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for its clear obedience, meer obedience that makes thee go on in a low calling; but there may be much ſelf-love that makes men go on in a higher calling, for there's Riches, Credit, and account in the world, and rewards comes in by that, which doth not in the other: to go on quietly in a low calling is more obedience to God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Know further in the laſt place, There is like to be more reward: For the Lord when he comes to reward, he doth not come to examine what the work hath been that men and women have been exerciſed in, but what their faithfulneſs hath been, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant,</hi> ſaith the Lord; he doth not ſay, well done good ſervant for thou haſt been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me in publick works, ruling Cities and States, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Kingdomes, and therefore thou ſhalt be rewarded, No, but, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant;</hi> now thou mayeſt be <hi>faithful</hi> in little as well as others are in more, by going on and working thy daies labor, when thou getteſt but a couple of ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:132683:97"/>to maintain thy family, thou mayeſt be as faithful in this as thoſe are that rule a Kingdome; now God looks to a mans faithfulneſs, and thou mayſt have as great a reward for thy faithfulneſs that art a poor Servant in the Kitchin all the day, as another that ſits upon the Throne all day, and as great a Crown of Glory thou mayeſt have at the day of Judgement, as a King that ſits upon the Throne, that hath ruled for God upon his Throne; yea, thy faithfulneſs may be rewarded by God with as great glory, as a King that hath ſwayed his Scepter for God; becauſe (I ſay) the Lord doth not ſo much look at the work that is done, as at the faithfulneſs of our hearts in doing it; then why ſhould not every one of us go on comfortably and cheerfully in our low condition, for why may not I be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as well as another? It's true, I cannot come to be as rich a man, and as honorable as others, but I may be as faithful as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other man, that every one of you may conclude with your ſelves: What doth let but that you that are the pooreſt and meaneſt may be as faithful as the greateſt, yea you may have as glorious a Crown in Heaven, and therefore go on comfortably and cheerfully in your way.</p>

                  <p>There's another reaſoning that ſome may have, and that is this. <hi>Oh! I could bear much affliction in ſome other way, but this is very grievous to me; the unſetledneſs of my condition; though my condition were but low, yet if it were in a ſetled way, I could be content, but it is ſo unconſtant, and ſo unſetled, that I can never know what to truſt to, but am toſt up and down in the world in an unſetled condition, and this is hard to be content with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to that I anſwer, Firſt, that the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>That every man in his ſetled eſtate is vanity,</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36.5. Your books have it, Every man at his <hi>beſt estate</hi> is vanity, the word is, his <hi>ſetled Eſtate;</hi> you think if you were but ſetled, Oh then you could be content, but the truth is, man in his ſetled eſtate is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer thus, That perhaps God ſees it is better for thee to live in a continual dependance upon him, and not to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:132683:98"/>know what thy condition ſhall be on the morrow, then for thee to have a more letled condition in reſpect of the comforts of the creatures; do but remember that we ſpake of before, that Chriſt doth not teach you to pray, Lord, give me enough that wil ſerve me for two or three years, but, <hi>this day our daily bread;</hi> to teach us we muſt live upon God in a dependant condition every day for daily bread. Here was the difference that is obſervable between the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> that depended upon God for the watering of it with ſhowres from Heaven, but <hi>Egypt</hi> had a conſtant way of watring the Country, that did not ſo much depend upon Heaven for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but upon the River <hi>Nylus,</hi> which did at ſome certain time overflow the Country: and they knowing that the watering of their Country did depend upon that river, and not upon Heaven they grew more proud: and therefore the Scripture to expreſs <hi>Pharoahs</hi> pride, brings him in ſaying, <hi>The river is mine:</hi> he could order the River as he pleaſed, for it was his: <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was a Country which was to depend upon God, though they had rain at one time, yet they knew not whether they ſhould have it at another time, and liv'd always in a dependance upon God, not knowing what ſhould become of them: Now God thought this to be a better Land for his people than <hi>Egypt,</hi> and this is given as one reaſon among others for it, becauſe the Lord lookt upon this as more ſuitable to the ſtate of his people that were to live by faith, to be continually depending upon Heaven, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Himſelf, and not to have a conſtant ſetled way in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their outward dependance. And we find it by experience, that when thoſe that are godly live in the greateſt dependance upon God, and have no ſetled comings in from the creature, they do exerciſe Faith more, and are in a better condition for their ſouls than before. Oh! many times it falls out, that the worſe thy outward eſtate is, the better thy ſoul is, and the better thy outward eſtate is, the worſe thy ſoul is. We read in <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.13. the objection that the enemies had againſt the people of <hi>Iſraels</hi> building of the wall of the City: their writing to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> againſt them, ſaith, <hi>Be it known unto the King, that if the City be builded. and the walls ſet up again, then they will not pay toll, tribute, and cuſtome: and ſo thou ſhalt endamage the revenue of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:132683:98"/>Kings.</hi> If the wall be built (ſay they) then they will refuſe to pay toll, tribute, and cuſtome to the King: that is thus, ſo long as they live in ſuch a condition, where they have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance wholly upon the King, and lie at the Kings mercy, that is, they are in no City that hath walls built, but the King may come upon them when he will, ſo long they will pay cuſtome to the King, but if once they come to build a wall, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, and have not their dependance upon the King as before, then they will deny paying toll, tribute, and cuſtome. So it is thus for all the world between God and mens ſouls, when a ſoul lives in a way of meer dependance upon God, that ſenſibly he ſees God hath him at advantage every moment, Oh then ſuch a ſoul will pay toll and cuſtome, that ſoul exerciſes faith, and begs every day his daily bread; but if God hedges that man about with an eſtate, with proſperity, perhaps he hath an inheritance befaln him, perhaps he hath a conſtant Office that brings in ſo much yearly to him duly paid, this man is not ſo ſenſible now of his dependance upon God, he begins now to pay leſs toll and cuſtome to God than before; God hath leſs ſervice from this man now than before. God ſees it better for his people to live in a depending condition: we are very loth in reſpect of God to be dependant, we would be all Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants this way, we would be of our ſelves, and have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Lord, but God ſees it better for us to live in a depending condition.</p>
                  <p>Further, This may be thy comfort, though for outward things thou art mightily unſetled, yet for the great things of thy ſoul and eternal eſtate, there thou art ſetled, there thou haſt a ſetled way, a conſtant way of fetching ſupply, <hi>Of his fulneſs we receive grace, for grace,</hi> thou haſt there abundance of treaſure to go to, and ſetch all that thou ſtandeſt in need of, and obſerve it, that now thy condition is more ſetled in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace than it was in the Covenant of works; in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works there God gave man a ſtock to trade with, but he put it in his own hand, ſo that he might trade and get or loſe; but now in the Covenant of Grace God makes ſure, the ſtock is kept in the hand of Chriſt, and we muſt go to him for ſupply continually, for Chriſt keeps the ſtock; perhaps
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:132683:99"/>we may trifle away ſomewhat in our trading, but God takes that care ſtill we ſhould never ſpend the ſtock: As a man when his ſon breaks, having ſquandred away his ſtock that he gave him before, afterwards he puts his ſtock into a friends hand, and, ſaith he, you ſhall keep this ſtock, and it ſhall not be at his diſpoſe; ſo we are in a more ſetled condition, in reſpect of our eternal eſtate, than <hi>Adam</hi> was in Innocency; therefore let that comfort us in all our unſetled conditions in the matters of the world.</p>

                  <p>But yet there's another reaſoning that many murmuring hearts think to ſeed their humour withall, (ſay they) <hi>If I never had been in a better condition, then I could bear this affliction, if God had always kept me in ſo low a condition I could be content, Oh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> there was a time that I proſpered more, and I had things at a more full hand, and therefore now it is harder to me to be brought low, as in theſe times perhaps a man that had five or ſix hundred a year, but now hath had nothing for a great while, if that man had not been born to ſo much, or never had proſpered in any higher degree than now he is in, this affliction had been leſs, perhaps he hath ſome money and friends to live upon, but if he had never been in a higher condition, he would not have accounted it ſo great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have been without it now; This many times is our greatest wound that once we were in a better condition: and this is the moſt unreaſonable thing for us to murmure upon this ground of any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For firſt, Is thy eye evil, becauſe God hath been good to thee heretofore? It's an ill thing for us to have our eye evil, becauſe God is good to others, but to look upon our condition with an evil eye now, becauſe God was once good to us; hath God done thee any wrong, becauſe he was formerly more good to thee than he was to others?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou didſt heretofore more proſper? Did God heretofore give thee more proſperity? it was to prepare thee for afflictions; we ſhould look at all our outward proſperity as a preparation to afflictions, if thou hadſt done ſo then, it would not have been ſo difficult for thee to have endured affliction now when thou hadſt a great eſtate, yet if thou hadſt made uſe of this mercy of God to prepare thee for thy afflicted eſtate, then
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:132683:99"/>the change of thy eſtate would not be ſo grievous. That every Chriſtian ſhould do: have I an eſtate now? I ſhould prepare for poverty. Have I health now? I ſhould prepare for ſickneſs. Have I liberty? let me prepare my ſelf for impriſonment: What know I what God may call me to? Have I comfort and peace now in my conſcience? Doth God ſhine upon me? While I have this, let me prepare for Gods withdrawing from me. Am I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from temptations? Let me prepare now for the time of temptations; If thou wouldeſt do ſo, the change of thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not be ſo grievous to thee. Marriners that are in a calm will prepare for ſtorms, would they ſay, if we never had calms, we would bear ſtorms? But now we have had calms ſo many years or weeks together, this is grievous: In thy calm thou art to prepare for ſtorms, and the ſtorm would be leſs, thou ſhouldeſt reaſon quite contrary, and ſay, Now I am in an afflicted condition, Oh but bleſſed be God, <hi>I was in a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition,</hi> and bleſſed be God that he was afore-hand with me in the ways of his mercy, this one conſideration may help murmuring hearts. Doſt thou murmure becauſe once thou wert better? Know God was before-hand with thee in the ways of mercy, thou ſhouldeſt rather think thus, I have lived for theſe many years (forty years perhaps or more) in a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition, I have lived in health, and peace, and plenty, what though the remaining part of my time hath ſome ſorrow and affliction? The Lord hath granted to me a comfortable ſun-ſhine all the day long till towards evening, and what if at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight a clock at night it begins to rain? Let me thank God I have had ſo fair weather all day. You that are going a voyage, if you have a comfortable wind, and very fair for many moneths together, what if you have a little ſtorm when you are within ſight of land, will you murmure and repine? Oh no, but rather bleſs God that you have had ſuch a comfortable voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſo long: Oh this conſideration would help us all: If it were ſo that now God ſhould ſay, Well, You ſhall never ſee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable day more for outward things in this world, Oh then you have cauſe to fall down and bleſs Gods Name that you have had ſo many comfortable daies: now you reaſon quite contrary, whereas you ſhould bleſs God that you have
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:132683:100"/>had ſo much comfort, you make what you have had before to be an aggravation of your afflictions now, and ſo murmure and are diſcontented. That which God gave you before, upon what terms did you hold it? Did you hold it ſo as you have in your writings, <hi>To have and to hold for ever,</hi> God gives no ſuch thing, God gives to no man (I ſay) any thing but grace to run upon that tenour, there's no ſuch thing in all Gods writings for any outward comforts, <hi>To have and to hold for you and your heirs;</hi> indeed for grace he doth give it to your ſelves, <hi>To have and to hold for ever;</hi> though not for every one that comes out of your Loyns to have and to hold for ever; God doth not give any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing ſo upon any ſuch tenour as that is; if God gives me an underſtanding of himſelf, and faith, and humility, and love, and patience, and ſuch graces of his ſpirit; he gives them me for ever, if he gives me himſelf, and his Chriſt, and his Promiſe, and his Covenant, he gives me them for ever, what am I therefore that the Sun ſhould always ſhine upon me, that I muſt have fair weather all my days? That which God gives to me, he gave it to me as a pledge of his love, let me return in to him as a pledge of my obedience, there's all the reaſon in the world for it, all that a godly man receives from God, he receives it as a pledge of Gods love to him, therefore when he comes into an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſaith God, Return to me as a pledge of your obedience that you had from me as a pledge of my love; we ſhould cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully come in to God, and bleſs God that we have any thing to render unto him as a pledge of our obedience, and ſay, O it is thy love, O Lord, that hath given us any thing, that doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to render a pledge of our obedience to thee. When God calls for thy eſtate, or any comforts that thou haſt, God calls for it as a pledge of thy obedience to him.</p>

Secondly, When thou didſt take a great deal of pains, was it not with ſubmiſſion to God? Didſt thou take pains with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, that thou muſt have ſuch a thing when thou laboureſt for it? Then know that thou laboureſt not as a Chriſtian, but if thou didſt labour and take pains, was it not with reſignation to God? Lord, I am taking pains in the way of my calling, but with ſubmiſſion, I depend wholly upon thee for ſucceſs, and a bleſſing: And what was it that thou didſt aim at in thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? Was it not that thou mighteſt walk with God in the place that God hath ſet thee? A Chriſtian ſhould do ſo in his outward calling, I am diligent in my outward calling, but it is, that I might obey God in it; it's true, I do it that I might provide for my family, but the chief thing that I aim at is, That I might yield obedience to God in the way that God hath ſet me: Now if God calls thee to another condition to obey him in, though it be by ſuffering, thou wilt do it if thy heart be right.</item>

Thy outward comforts hath coſt thee much, and thou haſt taken much pains to obtain them, and now if thou canſt ſubmit to God in the want of them: (I ſay) in this thy love is the more ſhown, that thou canſt offer that to God that coſt thee dear.

Oh thou haſt had mercy enough already to make thee ſpend all the ſtrength thou haſt, and time thou ſhalt live, to bleſs God for what thou haſt had already. I remember I have read of a good man that had liv'd to fifty years of age, and enjoyed his health for eight and forty years exceeding well, and liv'd in proſperity, and the two laſt years his Body was exceedingly diſcaſed, he had the Strangury, and was in great pain; but he reaſoned the caſe with himſelf thus; Oh Lord, thou mighteſt have made all my life to have been a life of torment and pain, but thou haſt let me have eight and forty years in health: I will praiſe thy mercies for what I have had, and will praiſe thy Juſtice for what now I feel. Oh it's a good conſideration for us to think that God is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with us in the way of mercy: Suppoſe God ſhould now take away your eſtates from ſome of you that have lived com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably a great while, you will ſay, That aggravates our miſery that we have had eſtates; but it is through thy unthankfulneſs that it doth ſo; we ſhould bleſs God for what we have had, and not think that we are worſe becauſe we have had thus and thus, we might have been always miſerable, and certainly that mans condition is not very miſerable, that hath no other greater aggravation of his miſery, but becauſe once he was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:132683:104"/>thing in way of ſervice for God; certainly there is not ſo great a diſtance between other creatures and Man-kind, as there is between Man-kind and God. 'Tis an expreſſion of that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr Maſter <hi>Hooper,</hi> that we read of in the Book of Martyrs, in labouring to work his own heart, and the hearts of others to contentedneſs in the midſt of his ſufferings; he hath this ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and you may be put in mind of that every day, (ſaith he) I look upon the creature, and ſee what it ſuffers to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me: as thus, The bruit beaſts muſt die, muſt be roaſted in the fire, and boyl'd, muſt come upon the trencher, be hackt all in pieces, muſt be chewed in the mouth, and in the ſtomach turn'd to that which is loathſome, if one ſhould behold it, and all to nouriſh me, to be uſeful to my body; and ſhall not I be willing to be made any thing for God, for his ſervice; what abundance of alterations the creature comes under to be made uſeful for me, to preſerve me; then if God will do ſo with me for his uſe, as he doth ſubject the creatures to me for my uſe, why ſhould not I reſt contented? If God will take away my eſtate, and make me poor, if God will take away my life, hack me in pieces, put me in priſon, whatſoever he doth, yet I ſhall not ſuffer more for God then the creature doth for me, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am infinitely more bound to God than the creature is to me, and there is not ſo much diſtance between me and the creature, as between me and God: ſuch Conſiderations as theſe wrought the heart of that Martyr to contentedneſs in his ſufferings. And every time the creature is upon your trenchers, you may think, What! doth God make the creature ſuffer for my uſe? not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for my nouriſhment, but for my delight; what am I then in reſpect of the infinite God?</p>

Yea, you ſee that many men of the world have a kind of Contentment, do not murmure nor repine when the world comes, though they have no intereſt in God and Chriſt. Then canſt not thou have as much Contentment with God and Chriſt without the world, as they can with the world without God and Chriſt? This is infinite ſhame it ſhould be ſo.</p>

                  <p>Yea laſtly, Conſider all the experience that you have had, of Gods doing good unto you in the want of many comforts. When God croſſes you, have you never had experience of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good in afflictions? It's true, when a Miniſter only tells men that God will work good out of their afflictions, they hear them ſpeak, and think they ſpeak like good men, but they feel little or no good, they feel nothing but pain; but when we cannot only ſay to you, that God hath ſaid he will
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:132683:106"/>work good out of your afflictions, but we can ſay to you, that you your ſelves have found it ſo by experience, that God hath made former afflictions to be great benefits to you, and that you would not have been without them, or without the good that came by them for a world; ſuch experiences will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly quiet the heart, and work it to contentment: therefore think thus with thy ſelf, Lord, why may not this affliction work as great a good upon me as afflictions have done hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Perhaps you may find many other Conſiderations beſides in your own meditations, theſe are the principal ones that I have thought upon: I'le only add one word more to this, of one that once was a great Merchant and Trades-man, and it happened on a time that he ſuffered Ship-wrack, and ſaith he, I never made a better voyage, and ſail'd better, than at that time that I ſuffered Ship wrack: this was a ſtrange ſpeech (his name was <hi>Zeno</hi>) that he ſhould never make a better voyage: it would be a ſtrange paradox to you that are Marriners, to ſay, that that's a good voyage when you ſuffer Ship-wrack: but he meant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he got ſo much good by it, God was pleaſed to bleſs it ſo far to him that he gained ſo much unto his ſoul by it, ſo much ſoul-riches, that he made account it was the beſt voyage that ever he had: and truly, ſometimes it is ſo, yea, to you that are godly, I make no queſtion but you find it ſo, that your worſt voyages have proved your beſt, when you have met with the greateſt croſſes in a voyage, God hath been pleaſed to turn them to a greater good to you in ſome other way. It's true, we may deſire croſſes that they may be turned to other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; but when God in his providence doth ſo order things, that you meet with ill voyages, you may expect that God will turn them to a greater good, and thoſe that have been exerciſed in the ways of godlineſs any long time, I make no queſtion but they have abundance of experience that they have gain'd by them: You know ſometimes its better to be in a little Ship, for they have advantage of the greater ones in ſtorms, many times in a ſtorm a little ſhip can thruſt into a ſhallow place, and ſo be ſafe, but your great ſhips cannot, they muſt be abroad, and toſt up and down in the ſtorm and tempeſt, and ſo many times ſplit againſt the rocks. And ſo it may be God ſees there is a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:132683:106"/>ſtorm a coming, and if thou beeſt in thy great ſhip thou mayeſt be ſplit upon rocks and ſands, God therefore doth put thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a leſſer veſſel that thou mayſt be more ſafe. We will lay aſide the ſpeaking of thoſe Conſiderations now, but I would not have you lay them aſide, and put them out of your thoughts, but labour (thoſe eſpecially that moſt concern you) to make uſe of them in the needful time, when you find any diſcontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit to ariſe in you.</p>
                  <p>But the main thing that I intend for this Exerciſe, It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Directions what to do for the helping of our hearts to contentment. For as for any further conſiderations, we have prevented the ſpeaking largely of them, becauſe we have opened the moſt things in ſhewing what the leſſons are that Chriſt teaches men, when he brings them into his School, to teach them this Art. I ſay there we have ſpoken of the ſpecial things that are moſt conſiderable for the helping of us to this Grace of Contentment. Therefore now all that I ſhall further do about this point, ſhall be the giving of ſome directions what courſe to take that we may come to attain the Grace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>

                  <p>The firſt is this, All the rules and helps in the world will do us little good except we get a good temper within our hearts; you can never make a ſhip go ſteady with propping of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, you know there muſt be ballaſt within the ſhip, that muſt make it go ſteady: And ſo there is nothing without us that can keep our hearts in a ſteady conſtant way, but that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, Grace is within the ſoul, and that will do it.</p>

                  <head>The Second DIRECTION.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, If you would get a contented life, do not gripe too much of the world, do not take in more of the buſineſs of the world than God calls you to, be not greedy of taking in a great deal of the world, if a man will go among Thorns, when he may go in a plainer way, there is no reaſon that this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:132683:107"/>man ſhould complain that he is prickt with them; thou goeſt among Thorns, is it thy way? Muſt you of neceſſity go among them? Then its another matter, but if thou wilt electively chuſe that way when thou mayſt go another, then thou haſt no cauſe to complain; ſo for men and women that will put themſelves upon things of the world that they need not, then no marvel though they be prickt, and meet with that that doth diſquiet them? For ſuch is the nature of all things here in the world, that every thing hath ſome prick or other in it, we are like to meet with diſappointments, and diſcontentments in every thing we meddle with, and therefore thoſe that have leaſt to do in the world, (that is, except God calls them to it, we muſt put in that) they are like to meet with many things that will diſcontent them.</p>

                  <head>The Third DIRECTION.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, Be ſure of thy call to every buſineſs thou goeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, though it be in the leaſt buſineſs, be ſure of thy call to it: then whatever thou meeteſt withal thou mayeſt quiet thy heart with this, I know I am where God would have me; there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world will quiet the heart ſo much as this; when I meet with any croſſes, I know I am where God would have me in my place and calling, I am about the work that God hath ſet me, Oh this will quiet and content thee when thou meeteſt with trouble: that that God calls a man to, with that he may have comfort whatever befals him, God is to look to thee, and to ſee thee bleſt if thou beeſt in the work God calls thee to.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth DIRECTION.</head>
                  <p>And eſpecially if I add a Fourth Rule, and that is, <hi>That I walk by rule in that work I am called to.</hi> I am called to ſuch a buſineſs, but I muſt mannage this work that I am called to by Rule, I muſt walk by the Word, order my ſelf in this buſineſs according to Gods mind ſo far as I am able, then add this to the other, and then the quiet and peace of that ſoul may be made even perfect in a kind, when I know it is not the work I put my ſelf upon, but God hath called me to it, and I walk by
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:132683:107"/>the rule of the World in it, then let come what will come, God he is to take care of me there. It was a ſpeech of a Heathen (ſaith he) if thou wilt ſubject all things to thy ſelf, do thou ſubject thy ſelf to reaſon, and by that thou wilt make all things to be under thee: I may add a little more to it, if you will ſubject all things under you, ſubject your ſelf to God, and then the truth is, all things are under you; It hath been that which many times we have hinted, the reaſon why many of our Gentry have been ſo malignant among us is, becauſe they are willing to be ſlaves themſelves under ſome above them at Court, ſo they may keep their neighbours under to be ſlaves to them: for you knaw any man heretofore that was great at the Court, he could cruſh any Country-man that he was angry withall. If there were an Arbitrary Government, then all thoſe that would be willing to be vaſſals and ſlaves to the Prince, they can make all others vaſſals and ſlaves under them. Now be thou willing to be a vaſſal and ſlave unto God, to be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under Gods command, and then (I ſay) all things in the world are under thee, <hi>All are yours</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Life and Death,</hi> every thing is yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods: All things in the world are ſerviceable to that man or woman that is ſerviceable to God. It is a mighty commendation of Gods ſervice, be thou willing to be ſerviceable to God, and God makes all things in the world to be thy ſervants, for ſo they are. You will ſay, How are they my ſervants, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them? They are ſervants in this, that God doth order them all to work for thy good, there's nothing in the world: but (ſaith God) it ſhall work for thy good, and be ſerviceable to thee, if thou wilt be ſerviceable to me, who would not be now Gods Servant; Subject thy ſelf to God, and all things ſhall be ſubjected to thee. Now ſo long as we keep within our bounds we are under protection, but if once we break our bounds, we muſt expect it ſhould be with us as it is with the Deer in the Park; while the Deer keep within the Pale, there are no dogs come upon them, but they can feed quietly, but let the Deer be got without the Pale, and then every dog in the Country will be hunting after them: So it is with men, let men and women keep within the bounds of the Command of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:132683:108"/>God, of the rule that God hath ſet them in his word, and then they are protected by God, and they may go about their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with peace, and never be troubled for any thing, but caſt all their care upon God, God provides for them, but if they will go beyond the pale, if they will paſs their bounds, then they may expect to meet with troubles, and afflictions, and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and therefore that is a fourth direction. Walk by rule.</p>

                  <p>A fiſt Rule is this, <hi>Exerciſe much faith, that is the way for contentedneſs.</hi> After thou haſt done with all conſiderations that reaſon may ſuggeſt to thee, if thou findeſt that theſe do not do it, Oh then call for the grace of faith, a man may go very far with the uſe of Reaſon alone to help him to Contentment, but when Reaſon is at a non-plus, then ſet Faith at work. It was a ſpeech of that reverend Divine Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> that God made ſo inſtrumental in his time, the Life of Faith (ſaith he) it is a true life indeed, the only life. Exerciſe Faith not only in that promiſe that all ſhall work together for good to them that fear God, but likewiſe exerciſe faith in God himſelf, as well as in his word in the Attributes of God. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Socrates</hi> a Heathen, (ſaith he) ſince God is ſo careful for you, what need you be careful for any thing your ſelves; It was a ſtrange ſpeech of a Heathen.</p>
                  <p>Oh Chriſtian! if thou haſt any faith, in the time of extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, think thus, This is the time that God calls for the exerciſe of faith, what canſt thou do with thy faith if thou canſt not quiet thy heart in diſcontent: It was the ſpeech of one <hi>Theodoſius</hi> that had been a King, and afterwards was brought to ſuch a low condition to get his living by being a School-maſter, one comes and asks him, What have you got by your Phyloſophy from <hi>Plato</hi> and others; What have I got (ſaith he) I have got this, That though my condition be changed from ſo high a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſo low, yet I have got this, I can be content. So what doeſt thou get by being a Believer, a Chriſtian? what canſt thou do by thy faith? I can do this, I can in all eſtates caſt my care upon God, caſt my burden upon God, I can commit my
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:132683:108"/>way to God in peace, faith can do this. Therefore when reaſon can go no higher, let faith get upon the ſhoulders of reaſon, and ſay, I ſee land though reaſon cannot ſee it, I ſee good that will come out of all this evil.</p>
                  <p>Exerciſe faith in thy often reſignation of thy ſelf to God, in giving of thy ſelf up to God and his ways, the more thou doſt in a believing way ſurrender up thy ſelf to God, the more quiet and peace wilt thou have; that's the fift thing.</p>

                  <p>The ſixth Direction for Contentment is, <hi>To labour to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually minded;</hi> that is, be often in meditation of the things that are above, <hi>If we be riſen with Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>let us ſeek the things that are above, where Chriſt is that ſits at the right hand of God, Col.</hi> 3.1. Be much in ſpiritual thoughts, in converſing with things above; many Chriſtians that have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the things of Heaven, yet converſe but very little with them, their meditations are not much upon heavenly things. It is that that ſome give as the reaſon why <hi>Adam</hi> did not ſee his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, ſome think that he had ſo much converſe with God, and with things above ſenſe, that he did not ſo much mind or think of nakedneſs what it was: but whether that were ſo or no I will not ſay, but this I ſay and am certain of, the reaſon why we are ſo troubled with our nakedneſs, with any wants that we have, it's becauſe we converſe ſo little with God, ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with ſpiritual things, the converſing with ſpiritual things would lift us above the things of the world; Thoſe that are bit or ſtung with a Snake, it is becauſe they tread upon the ground, if they could be lifted up above the earth, they need never fear to be ſtung with the Snakes that are crawling underneath: ſo I may compare the ſinful diſtemper of murmuring, and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and evils that come from thence to be like Snakes that crawl up and down below, but if we could get higher we ſhould not be ſtung by them.

                     <hi>Labor to get your hearts mortified to the world, dead to the world:</hi> We muſt not content our ſelves that we have gotten ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning above the vanity of the creature, and ſuch kind of things as theſe are, but we muſt exerciſe mortification, and be crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world, ſaith <hi>Paul, I die daily;</hi> we ſhould die daily to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:132683:109"/>the world, <hi>We are baptized into the death of Chriſt,</hi> that is to ſignifie, that we have taken ſuch a profeſſion, as to profeſs to be even as dead men to the world; now there are no croſſes that fall out in the world that doth trouble thoſe that are dead, if our hearts were dead to the world, we ſhould not be much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the changes of the world, nor the toſſings about of worldly things. As it is very obſervable in thoſe Souldiers that came to break the bones of Chriſt, they brake the legs of one that was crucified with him, and of the other, but when they came to Chriſt they found he was dead, and ſo they did not break his legs, there was a providence in it, to fulfil a Propheſie, but becauſe they found he was dead, they did not break his bones. Let afflictions and trouble find thee with a mortified heart to the world, and they will not break thy bones; the bones of thoſe that are broken by croſſes and afflictions are thoſe that are alive to the world, that are not dead to the world; but one that hath a mortified heart, and dead to the world, no afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or troubles will break the bones of ſuch a one, that is, they will not be very grievous or painful to ſuch a one as is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to the world: This I fear is a myſtery and riddle to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for one to be dead to the world, to be mortified to the world. Now it is not my work to open to you what Mortification is, or death to the world is, but only thus, To have our hearts ſo taken off from the things of the world, as to uſe them as if one uſed them not, not to make account that our lives, our comforts, our happineſs doth conſiſt in theſe things, they are things that are of another nature that our happineſs doth conſiſt in, and we may be happy without theſe, this is a kind of deadneſs to the world.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:132683:110"/>always upon the ſore; and ſo men and women their thoughts are always upon their afflictions, when they awake in the night their thoughts are upon their afflictions, and when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with others (nay it may be when they are praying to God) they are thinking of their afflictions. Oh! no marvel though you live a diſcontented life, if your thoughts be always poring upon ſuch things, you ſhould rather labor to have your thoughts upon thoſe things that may comfort you: You ſhall have many that if you propound any rule to them to do them good, they take it well while they are with you, and thank you for it, but when they are gone they ſoon forget it. It is very obſervable of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that when his wife died in Child-birth, his wife called the Childe <hi>Ben-oni,</hi> that is, a ſon of ſorrows; now <hi>Jacob,</hi> he thought with himſelf, If I ſhould call this childe <hi>Ben-oni,</hi> every time that I name him, it will put me in mind of the death of my dear wife, and of that affliction, and that will be a continued affliction to me, therefore I will not have my child have that name; and ſo the text ſaith, that <hi>Jacob</hi> called his name <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and that was the ſon of my right hand: now this is to ſhew us thus much, that when afflictions befal us, we ſhould not give way to have our thoughts continually upon them, but rather upon thoſe things that may ſtir up our thankfulneſs to God for mercies. It is the ſimilitude of <hi>Baſil</hi> a learned man; ſaith he, It is in this caſe as it is with men and women that have ſore eyes, now it's not fit for thoſe to be always looking upon the fire, or upon the beams of the Sun; no (ſaith he) one that hath ſore eyes muſt get things that are ſuitable to him, and ſuch objects that are fit for one that hath weak eyes, therefore they will get green colours, as that being a more eaſie colour and better for weak eyes, and they will hang a green Sarſnet before their eyes becauſe it is more ſuitable to them: So weak ſpirits it's the very ſame, a man or woman that hath a weak ſpirit, they muſt not be looking upon the fire of their afflictions, upon thoſe things that deject, that caſt them down, but they are to be looking rathe upon that which may be ſuitable for the healing and helping of them, they ſhould be conſidering of thoſe things rather than the other. It will be of very great uſe and benefit to you if you do lay it to heart, not to be poring always upon afflictions, but upon mercies.</p>

It is very tedious to the Spirit of God when we make ſuch ill interpretations of his ways towards us. If God deal with us otherwiſe than we would have him, if there can be any ſenſe worſe than other made of it, we will be ſure to make it; as thus, When an affliction doth befal you, there may be many good ſenſes made of Gods Works towards you, you ſhould think thus, It may be God intends only to try me by this, it may be God ſaw my heart too much ſet upon the Creature, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſhew me what there is in my heart, it may be that God ſaw that if my eſtate did continue I ſhould fall into ſin, that the better my eſtate were, the worſe my ſoul would be, it may be God intended only to exerciſe ſome Grace, it may be God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to prepare me for ſome great work which he hath for me. Thus you ſhould reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But we on the contrary make bad interpretations of Gods thus dealing with us, and ſay, God doth not mean this, ſurely the Lord means by this, to manifeſt his wrath and diſpleaſure againſt me, and this is but a furtherance of further evils that he intends towards me: Juſt as they did in the Wilderneſs, <hi>God hath brought us hither to ſlay us.</hi> This is the worſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that poſſibly you can make of Gods ways: Oh!

I beſeech you conſider, God doth not deal by you as you deal with him, ſhould God make the worſt interpretation of all your ways to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, as you do of his towards you, it would be very ill with you, God is pleaſed to manifeſt his love thus to us, to make the beſt interpretations of what we do, and therefore it is that God doth put a ſenſe upon the actions of his people that one would think could hardly be, as thus, God is pleaſed to call thoſe perfect that have but any uprightneſs of heart in them, he accounteth them perfect, <hi>Be ye perfect as your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is perfect;</hi> uprightneſs in Gods ſenſe is perfection. Now alas when we look into our own hearts, we can ſcarce ſee any good at all there, and yet God is pleaſed to make ſuch an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation as to ſay, it is perfect: When we look into our own hearts we can ſee nothing but uncleanneſs, God, he calls you his Saints, he calls the meaneſt Chriſtian that hath the leaſt grace under the greateſt corruption, his Saint; you ſay, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Saints here, but yet in Gods eſteem we are Saints: You know the uſual title the Holy Ghoſt gives (in ſeveral of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles) to thoſe that had any grace, any uprightneſs, is, <hi>To the Saints</hi> in ſuch a place; you ſee what an interpretation God puts upon them, they are Saints to him, and ſo I might name in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other particulars, God makes the beſt interpretation of things; if there be abundance of evil and a little good, God rather paſſes by the evil, and takes notice of the good: That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have made uſe of, which is a very obſervable place in <hi>Peter</hi> concerning <hi>Sarah, Sarah</hi> had a ſpeech to her husband in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 18.12. She called her husband Lord, but there was but that one good word in an ill ſpeech, it was an unbelieving ſpeech, but yet when the Apoſtle mentions that ſpeech in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. the Holy Ghoſt leaves all the ill, and commends her for calling her husband Lord, for putting a reverent title upon her Husband; thus how graciouſly doth God deal with us? If there be but one good word among a great many ill, what an interpretation God makes! ſo ſhould we do, if there be but any
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:132683:111"/>one good interpretation that we can make of a thing, we ſhould rather make uſe of the good one than of the ill; Oh my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, (I would I could now ſpeak only to ſuch as are godly) retain good thoughts of God, take heed of judging God to be a hard Maſter, make good interpretations of his ways, and that's a ſpecial means to help you to contentment in all your courſes.</p>

                     <hi>Do not ſo much regard the fancies of other men, as what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you feel your ſelves;</hi> For the reaſon of our diſcontentment many times, is rather from the fancies of other men, than from what we find we want our ſelves, we think poverty to be ſuch a great evil, why? Becauſe it is ſo eſteemed by others, more than what people feel in it themſelves, except they be in extremity of poverty: I'le give you an evident demonſtration that almoſt all the diſcontent in the world is rather from the fancies of others, than from the evil that is upon themſelves. You that think your eſtates to be low, and you are thereupon diſcontent, and it is a grievous affliction to you, but if all the men in the world were poorer than you, then you would not be diſcontent, then you would rejoyce in your eſtates, though you had not a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than you have: As take a man that can get but his twelve pence a day, and you will ſay, this were but a poor thing to maintain a Family? But ſuppoſe there were no man in the world that had more than this, yea that all other men but your ſelves had ſomewhat leſs wages than you, then you would think your condition pretty good; you ſhould have no more then than you have now, therefore it appears by this, that it's rather from the fancies of other men, than what you feel, that makes you think your condition to be ſo grievous, for if all the men in the world lookt upon you as happy, more happy than themſelves, then you would be contented; Oh let not your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs depend upon the fancies of other men. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> I remember in this very caſe, Let us not make the people in this caſe to be our Lords, as we muſt not make men to be the Lords of our faith, ſo not the Lords of our comforts; that is, that our comfort ſhould depend more upon their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:132683:112"/>than upon what we feel in our ſelves. It may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think you to be in an afflicted condition, yea, but I thank God, for my ſelf I do not ſo apprehend it, were it not for the diſgrace, diſeſteem and ſlighting of other men, my condition would not be ſo bad to me as now it is; this is that which makes my condition afflictive.</p>

                     <hi>Be not inordinately taken up with the comforts of this world when you have them.</hi> When you have them, do not take too much content in them; that's a certain rule, that look how inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any man or woman is in ſorrow when a comfort is taken from them, ſo much immoderate were they in the rejoycing in the comfort when they had it; as now for inſtance, God takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a childe, and you are inordinately ſorrowful, beyond what God allows in a natural or Chriſtian way, now though I never knew before how your heart was towards the childe, yet when I ſee this (though you be a meer ſtranger to me) I may without breach of charity conclude, that your heart was immoderately ſet upon your childe or husband, or upon any other comfort that I ſee you grieving for, when God hath taken it away. If you hear ill tidings about your eſtates, and your hearts are dejected immoderately, and you are in a diſcontented way becauſe of ſuch and ſuch a croſs, certainly your hearts were immoderately ſet upon the world, and ſo likewiſe for your credit, if you hear others report this or that ill of you, and your hearts are deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted becauſe you think you ſuffer in your name, your hearts were inordinately ſet upon your name and credit, now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the way for you not to be immoderate in your ſorrows for afflictions, it is not to be immoderate in your love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights when you have proſperity. And theſe are the principal Directions for our help that we may live quiet, and contented lives.</p>
                  <p>My brethren, to conclude all for this point, If I could tell you that I knew how to ſhew you a way never to be in want of any thing, I make no queſtion but then we ſhould have much flocking to ſuch a Sermon, when a man ſhould undertake to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:132683:112"/>manifeſt to people that they ſhould never be in want any more, but I have been now preaching unto you, that that comes to as much, that which countervails this, that which is in effect all one. Is it not almoſt all one, never to be in want, or never to be without Contentment? that man or woman that is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a contented ſpirit, truly, can never be ſaid to want much; Oh! the Word holds forth a way full of comfort and peace to the people of God even in this world, you may live happy lives in the midſt of all the ſtorms and tempeſts in the world, there is an Ark that you may come into, and no men in the world may live ſuch comfortable, cheerful, and contented lives as the Saints of God: Oh that we had learned this Leſſon: I have been many Sermons about this Leſſon of Contentment, but I am afraid that you will be longer in learning of it, than I have been preaching of it; it is a harder thing to learn it than it is to ſpeak or preach it. (I remember) I have read of one man reading of that place in the 39. <hi>Pſal. I will take heed that I offend not with my tongue:</hi> ſaith be, I have been this 38. years a learning this leſſon, and have not learned it throughly. The truth is, there are many (I am afraid) that have been profeſſors neer eight and thirty years, have hardly learnt this leſſon; it were a good leſſon for young Profeſſors to begin to learn this betimes. But now, this leſſon of Chriſtian Contentment it is as hard, and perhaps you may be many years in learning it: I am afraid there be ſome Chriſtians that have not yet learned, <hi>Not to offend groſly with their tongues:</hi> The Scripture ſaith, <hi>All a mans Religion is vain, if he cannot bridle his tongue;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thoſe that make any profeſſion of godlineſs, one would think they ſhould quickly learn this leſſon, ſuch a leſſon that except learned, it makes all their Religion vain: But for this Leſſon of Chriſtian Contentment, it may take up more time to learn, and there's many that are learning it all the daies of their lives, and yet are not Proficients; but God forbid that it ſhould be ſaid of any of us concerning this Leſſon, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith of Widows in <hi>Timothy, That they were ever learning, and never came to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Oh let us not be ever learning this leſſon of Contentment, and yet never come to have skill in it. You would think it much if you had uſed the Sea
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:132683:113"/>twenty years, and yet to have attained to no skill in your Art of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, you will ſay, I have uſed the Sea 20 or 30 years, and I hope I may know by this time what belongs to Sea; Oh that you would but ſay ſo in reſpect of the Art of Chriſtianity! When there is any thing that's ſpoken concerning the duty of a Chriſtian. Oh that Chriſtians could but ſay, I have been a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian thus long, and I hope I am not to ſeek in ſuch a thing that is ſo neceſſary for a Chriſtian; here is a neceſſary leſſon for a Chriſtian that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He had learned in all eſtates therewith to be content.</hi> Oh! be not content with your ſelves till you have learned this leſſon of Chriſtian Contentment, gotten ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter skill in it than heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Now there is in the text another Leſſon, which is a hard Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>I have learned to abound,</hi> that doth not ſo neerly concern us at this time, becauſe the times are afflictive times, and there is now (more than ordinary) an uncertainty in all things in the world, in ſuch times as theſe are, there are few that have ſuch an abundance, that they need to be much taught in that leſſon.</p>
